these different nuclei, that's what they're called", "start": 7458.1, "duration": 4.08}, {"text": "and they sort of correspond to those shapes that I showed you in the human hypothalamus earlier", "start": 7462.18, "duration": 3.96}, {"text": "and you see that there's different systems, there's the system for eating and drinking, it's outlined in green", "start": 7466.14, "duration": 5.48},

the defensive ones are in magenta", "start": 7479.58, "duration": 5.3}, {"text": "and so those are the... you could think about those as the three fundamental value systems", "start": 7484.88,

eating and drinking system, your reproductive system, and your defensive system, but", "start": 7523.7, "duration": 4.7}, {"text": "the problem is that those things, first of all, can conflict,",

conflict in the present", "start": 7543.34, "duration": 3.48}, {"text": "but then they can conflict with other people doing the same thing", "start": 7546.82, "duration": 3.66}, {"text": "and they can conflict across time", "start": 7550.48, "duration": 2.32}, {"text": "and so partly the reason that you need the rest of your brain is to solve the problems from the solutions that the hypothalamus offers", "start": 7552.8, "duration": 7.4}, {"text": "and so, because you don't wanna just eat and drink, and reproduce and defend yourself", "start": 7560.2, "duration": 6.14}, {"text": "you wanna eat now, later, tomorrow, next week, and next month", "start": 7566.34, "duration": 5.1}, {"text": "while you're able to engage in reproductive activity and defend yourself", "start": 7571.44,

your brain to calculate that", "start": 7580.84, "duration": 2.68}, {"text": "and so what the rest of your brain has to do, roughly speaking, is regulate these", "start": 7583.52, "duration": 6.04},
