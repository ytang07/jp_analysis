say, well, the biggest, ugliest, meanest chimp...", "start": 385.68, "duration": 4.12}, {"text": "and the male dominance hierarchies in chimps seem to be the predominant ones, although the females

they puff up, including their tail, but they stand sideways", "start": 486.6, "duration": 4.2}, {"text": "and the reason they do that is because they look bigger", "start": 490.8, "duration": 2.52}, {"text": "right, 'cause they're trying to put up the most intimidating possible front", "start": 493.32, "duration": 3.38}, {"text": "so anyways, if two wolves are going at it, what they're really trying to do is to size each other up", "start": 496.7, "duration": 5.6}, {"text": "and they're trying to scare each other into backing off, fundamentally", "start": 502.3, "duration": 3.76}, {"text":

degenerates into violence", "start": 517.4, "duration": 6.5}, {"text": "and animals, and human beings, but animals in particular, have evolved very, very specific mechanisms", "start": 523.9,

incapacitating himself by winning", "start": 536.26, "duration": 6.36}, {"text": "so what happens with the wolves is that, you know, they growl at each other and posture display, and maybe they even snap at each other", "start": 542.62, "duration": 6.56}, {"text": "but the probability that they're gonna get into a full-fledged fight is pretty low", "start": 549.18, "duration": 4.1}, {"text": "and what happens is, one of the wolves backs off,  and flips over and shows his neck", "start": 553.28, "duration": 4.22}, {"text": "and that basically means: \"all right, tear it out,\" and the other wolf says:", "start": 557.5, "duration": 4.78}, {"text": "though of course he doesn't, \"well, you're kind of an idiot, and you're not that strong, but we might need you to take down a moose in the

established their dominance position, and then, from then on, at least for some substantial period of time", "start": 572.26, "duration": 5.98}, {"text": "the subordinate wolf gives way to the dominant wolf", "start": 578.24, "duration": 3.14}, {"text": "but at least the subordinate wolf is alive, and, you know, he might be dominant over other wolves", "start": 581.38, "duration": 4.76}, {"text": "and so, everyone in the whole hierarchy has sorted that out either through mock combat or through combat itself", "start": 586.14, "duration": 6.74}, {"text": "and, you know, the low-ranking members aren't in the best possible position, but at least they're not getting their heads torn off every second of their existence", "start": 592.88, "duration": 8.28}, {"text": "so there's even some utility in the stability of the dominance hierarchy for the low-ranking members", "start": 601.16, "duration": 5.4}, {"text": "'cause at least they're not getting pounded, getting threatened, which is way better", "start": 606.56, "duration": 4.74}, {"text": "I mean it's not good, but it's way better than actual combat", "start": 611.3, "duration": 3.3}, {"text": "and then there's the example of rats, which I love, this is Jaak Panksepp's work", "start": 614.6, "duration": 4.3}, {"text": "and he wrote a book called affective neuroscience, which I highly, highly recommend", "start": 618.9, "duration": 4.46}, {"text": "I have a list of readings, recommended readings on my website", "start": 623.36, "duration": 3.5}, {"text": "it's a brilliant book, and he's a brilliant psychologist, really, one of the top psychologists as far as I'm concerned", "start": 626.86, "duration": 6.82}, {"text": "both theoretically and experimentally, a real genius, he's the guy who discovered that rats laugh when you tickle them", "start": 633.68, "duration": 6.5}, {"text": "they laugh ultrasonically, so you can't actually hear them, but if you record it and slow it down", "start": 640.18, "duration": 5.22}, {"text": "then you can hear them giggling away when you tickle them with an erase, which  is sort of like their mother's tongue", "start": 645.4, "duration": 4.84}, {"text": "it's often what lab people use as a substitute for the licking of the little rat by the mother", "start": 650.24, "duration": 4.86}, {"text": "so, and he discovered the paly circuit in mammals, which is like a major deal, right", "start": 655.1, "duration": 5.78}, {"text": "he should get a Nobel prize for that, that's a big deal to discover an entire motivational circuit", "start": 660.88, "duration": 4.9}, {"text": "whose existence no one had really predicted, you know, apart from the fact that obviously mammals play", "start": 665.78, "duration": 5.48}, {"text": "and even lizards maybe, some of them are social lizards, seem to play", "start": 671.26, "duration": 4.56}, {"text": "so, anyhow, what Panksepp observed, and I think this is a brilliant piece of science", "start": 675.82, "duration": 5.98}, {"text": "is that, first of all, juvenile male rats in particular like to rough and tubmle play", "start": 681.8, "duration": 6.4}, {"text": "like to wrestle, and they actually pin each other like little kids do, or like adult wrestlers do", "start": 688.2, "duration": 5.22}, {"text": "they pin their shoulders down, and that basically means you win, and so, OK, so that's pretty cool", "start": 693.42, "duration": 5.02}, {"text": "but what's even cooler, I think, well there's three things, one is:", "start": 698.44, "duration": 3.74}, {"text": "the rats will work for an opportunity to get into an arena where they know that play might occur", "start": 702.18, "duration": 5.16}, {"text": "and so that's one of the scientific ways of testing an animal's motivation, right", "start": 707.34, "duration": 4.62}, {"text": "so imagine you have a starving rat and it knows that it's got food down in the end of a corridoor", "start": 711.96, "duration": 5.62}, {"text": "you can put a little spring on its tail and measure how hard it pulls, and that gives you and idication of its motivational force", "start": 717.58, "duration": 6.16}, {"text": "now, imagine the starving rat that's trying to get to some food, and you have a little spring on its tail, and you waft in some cat odor", "start": 723.74, "duration": 7.26}, {"text": "so now that rat is starving and wants to get out of there, he's going to pull even farther towards the food", "start": 731.0, "duration": 6.28}, {"text": "so getting away plus getting forward are separate motivational systems, and if you can add them together it's real potent", "start": 737.28, "duration": 6.32}, {"text": "and part of the reason why in the future authoring exercise that you guys are gonna do as the class progresses", "start": 743.6, "duration": 5.86}, {"text": "you're asked to outline the place you'd like to end up, which is your desired future", "start": 749.46, "duration": 3.88}, {"text": "and also the place that you could end up if you let everything fall apart", "start": 753.34, "duration": 4.62}, {"text": "so that your anxiety chases you and your approach systems pull you forward", "start": 757.96, "duration": 5.5}, {"text": "you're maximally motivated then, and it's important, because otherwise you can be afraid of pursuing the things you wanna pursue", "start": 763.46, "duration": 7.56}, {"text": "right, and that's very common, and so then the fear inhibits you as the promise pulls you forward", "start": 771.02, "duration": 5.5}, {"text": "but it makes you weak, because you're afraid; you wanna get your fear behind you, pushing you", "start": 776.52, "duration": 4.9}, {"text": "and so what you wanna be is more afraid of not pursuing your goals than you are of pursuing them", "start": 781.42, "duration": 5.9}, {"text": "it's very, very helpful; and lots of times in life, and this is something really worth knowing", "start": 787.32, "duration": 5.44},

"start": 796.94, "duration": 3.56}, {"text": "you have two bad choices, and you get to pick which one you're willing to suffer through", "start": 800.5, "duration": 4.26}, {"text": "and every choice has a bit of that element in it, and so, if you know that it's really freeing", "start": 804.76, "duration": 5.34}, {"text": "because otherwise you torture yourself by thinking: \"well, maybe there's a good solution to this, compared to the bad solution\"", "start": 810.1, "duration": 6.6}, {"text": "it's like, no, no, sometime's there's just risky solution 1, and risky solution 2", "start": 816.7, "duration": 5.12}, {"text": "and sometimes both of them are really bad, but you at least get to pick which one you're willing to suffer through", "start": 821.82, "duration": 6.18}, {"text": "and that's... that actually makes quite a bit of difference, because you're also facing it voluntarily then", "start": 828.0, "duration": 5.38}, {"text": "instead of it chasing you, and that is an entirely different psychophysiological response", "start": 833.38, "duration": 5.82}, {"text": "challenge vs threat, it's not the same, even if the magnitude of the problem is the same", "start": 839.2, "duration": 6.04}, {"text": "and so putting yourself in a challenging, let's call it, mindframe, you can't just do that by magic", "start": 845.24, "duration": 5.02}, {"text": "putting yourself in a challenging mindframe is much easier on you psychophysiologically", "start": 850.26, "duration": 5.44}, {"text": "'cause you don't produce... you don't go into the generalized stress response to the same degree", "start": 855.7, "duration": 4.66}, {"text": "and you're activating your exploratory and seeking systems, which are dopaminergically mediated, and that involve positive emotion",

especially if you also add the idea that if you go find the dragon in its lair", "start": 882.04, "duration": 4.98}, {"text": "you might find it when it's a baby, instead of a full-fledged bloody monster that is definitely gonna take you down", "start": 887.02, "duration": 6.02}, {"text": "and so that's part of the reason why... well there's a whole bunch of things that emerge out of that

so, you know, and that's partly why in psychotherapy a lot of times the people you see need assertiveness training", "start": 978.22, "duration": 6.54}, {"text": "so that would be the opposite of agreeableness, or they need help to get their anxiety and emotional pain under control", "start": 984.76, "duration": 5.96}, {"text": "those are not the only reasons, there's antisocial behavior, but you can't fix that in therapy in all likelyhood", "start": 990.72, "duration": 5.14}, {"text": "there's alcoholism, there's lotsa, lotsa other reasons, but those are two major reasons", "start": 995.86, "duration": 3.96}, {"text": "so anyways, there is a... that was all to telly you that... oh yes, back to the rats", "start": 999.82, "duration": 6.52}, {"text": "so okay, the rats are pulling on... you can measure rat motivation by how hard they pull on the spring, let's say", "start": 1006.34, "duration": 6.18}, {"text": "and they're more motivated if they're running away and they're running towards, but let's go back to play", "start": 1012.52, "duration": 5.2}, {"text": "so, you can take juvenile rats who haven't been able to play for a while, maybe they've been isolated", "start": 1017.72, "duration": 4.58}, {"text": "or maybe they just haven't been able to engage in physical activity, like many schoolchildren that you might be thinking about", "start": 1022.3, "duration": 7.22}, {"text": "neither allowed to play nor engage in physical activity, and there's a reason I'm telling you that", "start": 1029.52, "duration": 5.72}, {"text": "so anyways, you get one of these little rats, and you can measure how hard he'll pull to go out and play", "start": 1035.24, "duration": 5.58}, {"text": "or how many buttons he'll push, you know, and that gives you an indication of his motivation", "start": 1040.82, "duration": 4.06}, {"text": "so anyways, you can see that the play-deprived juvenile rat will fight harder to play than a non-play deprived juvenile rat", "start": 1044.88, "duration": 7.78}, {"text": "and so you can infer that the rat wants to go play", "start": 1052.66, "duration": 4.48}, {"text": "and, you know, you do that... you do the same measurement with everyone around you", "start": 1057.14, "duration": 4.76}, {"text": "if they wanna do something, you're gonna poke and prod at them to see what sort of things they're willing to overcome", "start": 1061.9, "duration": 5.9}, {"text": "in order to go and do that, you'll object even if you don't really object", "start": 1067.8, "duration": 3.68}, {"text": "it's like... it's a measurement device, and if they're willing to overcome a bunch of your objections", "start": 1071.48, "duration": 5.1}, {"text": "then you think: \"oh, well, maybe they really want to\"", "start": 1076.58, "duration": 2.34}, {"text": "and that's another thing to really know: if there's something you want, you need about five arguments about why you want it", "start": 1078.92, "duration": 7.74},

won't have thought it through enough; so the other thing that happens in the future authoring exercise", "start": 1093.68, "duration": 4.58}, {"text": "is that you're asked to articulate the reasons for all the goals that come out of your vision of the future", "start": 1098.26, "duration": 6.36}, {"text": "so you're asked like: \"why would it be good for you? why would it be good for your

that requires energy, a lot of different subsystems  in your mind are gonna throw up objections", "start": 1133.84, "duration": 5.24}, {"text": "it's like, \"well, maybe that isn't what you should be doing right now, maybe you should be doing the dishes", "start": 1139.08, "duration": 3.98}, {"text": "or vacuuming, or watching TV, or looking at YouTube\"", "start": 1143.06, "duration": 2.9},

that temptation, which you often will", "start": 1156.58, "duration": 4.8}, {"text": "then it wins, and because it wins, it gets a little dopamine kick, and it grows stronger", "start": 1161.38,

out, so... and then the one's you built to inhibit can be taken out by stress", "start": 1193.02, "duration": 6.68}, {"text": "and the old habits will come back up, so you gotta be careful what you say and what you do", "start": 1199.7, "duration": 5.06}, {"text": "because you build yourself that way; so anyways, back to the rats", "start": 1204.76, "duration": 4.64}, {"text": "okay, so the little rat gets to go out there and play, now imagine one little rat is paired with another rat", "start": 1209.4, "duration": 4.82}, {"text": "but the other little rat is 10% bigger, 10% in juvenile

them, then you let them play again, and the next time what happens", "start": 1233.2, "duration": 4.06}, {"text": "is that the subordinate rat does the invitation to play", "start": 1237.26,

and looks up and looks interested", "start": 1244.08, "duration": 4.62}, {"text": "and then it sort of dances around; you can do it with any kid that has a clue, you know", "start": 1248.7,

like, they know exactly what's gonna happen, you know, they're ready to dart back and forth", "start": 1258.32, "duration": 4.58}, {"text": "and they'll usually smile, and kids love rough and tumble play, which is now basically illegal in all daycare", "start": 1262.9, "duration": 7.46}, {"text": "seriously, it's seriously is, kids need it so desperately, 'cause it teaches them the limits of their body", "start": 1270.36, "duration": 6.14}, {"text": "and your body, and it teaches them what's painful and what isn't", "start": 1276.5, "duration": 3.96}, {"text": "and it teaches them the dance of play, and without that they're just little disembodied blobs", "start": 1280.46, "duration": 5.7}, {"text": "like, they have no finesse, that's what you're checking out when you dance with someone, you know", "start": 1286.16, "duration": 4.3}, {"text": "you're seeing if they have that fluency and facility for mutual reciprocal action", "start": 1290.46, "duration": 6.2}, {"text": "embodied in them; and if they're kinda like this, you know, and don't have any sense of rhythm and don't pay any attention to you", "start": 1296.66, "duration": 6.9}, {"text": "and all of that, you have reason to question whether they actually inhabit their body", "start": 1303.56, "duration": 4.96}, {"text": "and whether they can engage in a mutual interaction, physical interaction that's going to be reciprocal and mutually satisfying", "start": 1308.52, "duration": 7.48}, {"text": "it's really important to check out; and a lot of that rough and tubmle play, even interactions between a child and its mother", "start": 1316.0, "duration": 6.94}, {"text": "if you have a happy mother and a happy infant, and you videotape them, and you speed up the video tape, you'll see that they're dancing", "start": 1322.94, "duration": 7.52}, {"text": "so one responds, then the other responds, then the other responds, it might be just with eye gaze, and movement, and all of that", "start": 1330.46, "duration": 6.24}, {"text": "but there's a dynamic interplay, which you don't see with depressed mothers and their infants", "start": 1336.7, "duration": 4.98}, {"text": "so, okay, so back to play, so the little rat, who is the subordinate one, he has to do the invitation", "start": 1341.68, "duration": 7.1}, {"text": "and then the big rat can agree to play, 'cause he's in the dominant position", "start": 1348.78, "duration": 4.74}, {"text": "but if you pair them repeatedly, and this is really worth thinking about", "start": 1353.52, "duration": 4.72}, {"text": "because, you see, morality emerges out of repeated interactions", "start": 1358.24, "duration": 4.2}, {"text": "because, you might say, if you only interact with someone once, you might as well just take advantage of them and run off", "start": 1362.44, "duration": 5.84}, {"text": "that's what a psychopath does, by the way, and there is room in the environmental niche for psychopaths", "start": 1368.28, "duration": 7.12}, {"text": "but they have to keep moving around, 'cause otherwise people figure out who they are", "start": 1375.4, "duration": 3.54}, {"text": "so they just move around, and they can take advantage of one person, you know, maybe five times, or ten times, or something", "start": 1378.94, "duration": 5.66}, {"text": "and then the reputation spreads, and they gotta get the hell out of there", "start": 1384.6, "duration": 3.56}, {"text": "but... so it's not a good long-term strategy, unless you can't think of a better one", "start": 1388.16, "duration": 4.46}, {"text": "so anyways, if you repeatedly pair these rats, unless the big rat lets the little rat win at least 30% of the time", "start": 1392.62, "duration": 7.84}, {"text": "the little rat will not ask the big rat to play", "start": 1400.46, "duration": 3.0}, {"text": "and that is... it's a staggering discovery, it's a staggering discovery", "start": 1403.46, "duration": 5.06}, {"text": "because you've got the emergence there of an implicit morality, essentially", "start": 1408.52, "duration": 4.7}, {"text": "that's even incarnated in rats, that emerges across multiple play sessions", "start": 1413.22, "duration": 4.16}, {"text": "it's like, yes, exaclty, that's exactly what Piaget said about the emergence of morality", "start": 1417.38, "duration": 4.94}, {"text": "it's exactly the same idea, at the rat level, so it's a massively...", "start": 1422.32, "duration": 4.7}, {"text": "and the fact that there's a circuit, a separate neurophysiological circuit", "start": 1427.02, "duration": 4.02}, {"text": "that's actually specialized for that sort of thing is also a big deal", "start": 1431.04, "duration": 4.08}, {"text": "now the other thing  Panksepp figured out is that if you deprive juvenile rats of the opportunity to engage in rough and tumble play", "start": 1435.12, "duration": 7.5}, {"text": "their prefrontal cortexes don't develop properly", "start": 1442.62, "duration": 2.62}, {"text": "and they become impulsive and restless, and then you can fix them with methylphenidate or ritalin", "start": 1445.24, "duration": 6.1}, {"text": "and those are the drugs that are used to fix hyperactive kids, most of who are male", "start": 1451.34, "duration": 6.54}, {"text": "and that's because, well, really, you're gonna take your six-year-old, your five-year-old", "start": 1457.88, "duration": 5.06}, {"text": "you're gonna put them in a desk, you're gonna get them to sit there for six hours, that's your plan, right?", "start": 1462.94, "duration": 5.88}, {"text": "that's a stupid plan; and they're denied the opportunity to engage in play", "start": 1468.82, "duration": 5.64}, {"text": "and that means that their ability to become social is being impaired", "start": 1474.46, "duration": 5.18}, {"text": "it may cause neurological impairment, that's what the rat evidence suggests", "start": 1479.64, "duration": 3.74}, {"text": "and then you suppress that with amphetamines, 'cause amphetamines actually activate the play circuit", "start": 1483.38, "duration": 6.1}, {"text": "they activate a different circuit, which will suppress the play circuit", "start": 1489.48, "duration": 3.84}, {"text": "so it's very, very... it's not very wise, and I'm not gonna go off on that tangent", "start": 1493.32, "duration": 5.4}, {"text": "because I could tell you why the school systems were set up that way, which I probably will at some point", "start": 1498.72, "duration": 5.28}, {"text": "because it's quite and interesting story in and of itself, and it's the reason all you guys are sitting in desks right now", "start": 1504.0, "duration": 6.4}, {"text": "somebody laughingly referred to this once as grade 15, that was pretty funny, given the look of the bloody place, you know", "start": 1510.4, "duration": 7.46}, {"text": "hideous... okay", "start": 1517.86, "duration": 4.16}, {"text": "so, now, this is an interesting thig, so you got the emergence of morality in, say chimps", "start": 1522.02, "duration": 5.88}, {"text": "you got the emergence of morality in wolves, you got the emergence of morality in rats", "start": 1527.9, "duration": 3.7}, {"text": "and the morality governs sequential interactions or group interactions, they have to repeat", "start": 1531.6, "duration": 6.16}, {"text": "because, because it's an emerging property of social or repetitive interactions", "start": 1537.76, "duration": 5.42}, {"text": "that's why, you can't just localize it in one instance, it's repeated", "start": 1543.18, "duration": 4.08}, {"text": "and there's been computer simulations of this", "start": 1547.26, "duration": 2.74}, {"text": "they help you figure out how you might attain victory across games, across time", "start": 1550.0, "duration": 4.66}, {"text": "maybe you need a strategy, and there's a very simple strategy, which, I believe is called \"modified tit for tat\"", "start": 1554.66, "duration": 6.82}, {"text": "so if you're nice to me, I'm nice back, and if you do something bad to me, I do something bad back", "start": 1561.48, "duration": 4.52}, {"text": "but imagine you run that out in sequences of behavior, and see who does with what strategy across time", "start": 1566.0, "duration": 7.18}, {"text": "or an alternative strategy... [?] here's the best strategy: I trust you, you trust me, we start interacting", "start": 1573.18, "duration": 6.48}, {"text": "you screw up, I whack you, and then I forgive you, and we start again", "start": 1579.66, "duration": 3.96}, {"text": "that's modified tit for tat, and so...", "start": 1583.62, "duration": 2.86}, {"text": "it's a very simple algorithm; no one has come up with a better algorithm in a computerized simulation of game space than that particular strategy", "start": 1586.48, "duration": 9.58}, {"text": "so it's like: trust but don't be a pushover, if someone violates the rules, you gotta nail them", "start": 1596.06, "duration": 5.9}, {"text": "but then you don't hold a grudge, you open the door to further interactions", "start": 1601.96, "duration": 4.04}, {"text": "so, pretty smart, pretty smart", "start": 1606.0, "duration": 2.88}, {"text": "and, okay, so anyways... so what this means, 'cause rats can't talk, and wolves can't talk, and chimpanzees can't talk", "start": 1608.88, "duration": 6.96}, {"text": "and what that means, just as Piaget suggested, was that the morality, the development of the morality", "start": 1615.84, "duration": 6.12}, {"text": "precedes the development of the linguistic ability to describe the rules for the morality", "start": 1621.96, "duration": 4.76}, {"text": "he said exactly the same thing about kids, right, is that they learn to play games before they know what the rules are to the games", "start": 1626.72, "duration": 7.2}, {"text": "and so, you see that when you're playing peek-a-boo with a kid, they can pick that up really young", "start": 1633.92, "duration": 4.84}, {"text": "they get that right away, and there's... you can play with kids almost immediately after they're born, if you play simple enough games", "start": 1638.76, "duration": 6.56}, {"text": "so they've got that deep, and they're unbelievably playful", "start": 1645.32, "duration": 3.18}, {"text": "so, they've got that circuitry ready to go right off the bat, and it's one of the things that makes kids so much fun", "start": 1648.5, "duration": 6.86}, {"text": "because they just like to play all the time, and so if you... if the play circuit in you hasn't died", "start": 1655.36, "duration": 7.08}, {"text": "which is a bad thing, then you can use that a lot with your kids, and it's one of the things that helps you love them", "start": 1662.44, "duration": 5.68}, {"text": "so that's a good thing, so, okay", "start": 1668.12, "duration": 3.28}, {"text": "so, the point is that the damn morality emerges before the representation of the morality", "start": 1671.4, "duration": 6.88}, {"text": "it's a big deal to know that, and that it emerges as a consequence of repeated social interaction", "start": 1678.28, "duration": 5.32}, {"text": "so it's not a top-down thing, it's a bottom-up thing", "start": 1683.6, "duration": 3.96}, {"text": "now, Piaget says: well, it's not just bottom-up, because what happens with human beings is that they learn to play the games...", "start": 1687.56, "duration": 6.3}, {"text": "one of his experiments was: watch seven-year-olds, I think that's the right age, play marbles", "start": 1693.86, "duration": 6.76}, {"text": "and then he noticed that they can play with each other, and that they can follow the rules", "start": 1700.62, "duration": 4.58}, {"text": "but that if you take the individual seven-year-old out of the game, and you say: what are the rules?", "start": 1705.2, "duration": 4.4}, {"text": "they give incoherent and incomplete explanations of the rules", "start": 1709.6, "duration": 3.76}, {"text": "so what that means is they don't really represent the rules, but they can act them out", "start": 1713.36, "duration": 4.76}, {"text": "and have a partial representation of what they're acting out", "start": 1718.12, "duration": 3.76}, {"text": "now, when they get older, the rule representation starts to fall into alignment with the actual rules of the game", "start": 1721.88, "duration": 5.74}, {"text": "and you can imagine that's why [?], because when they're playing something like marbles, they're gonna have discussions like: you're cheating", "start": 1727.62, "duration": 6.18}, {"text": "or: you're not allowed to do that, 'cause they're always gonna be pushing the envelope a little bit", "start": 1733.8, "duration": 4.28}, {"text": "and then the group is gonna render a judgment on whether or not that's appropriate", "start": 1738.08, "duration": 3.84}, {"text": "and out of that the rules are going emerge, but they're not rules to begin with, they're patterns of behavior", "start": 1741.92, "duration": 5.62}, {"text": "it's not the same thing as a rule, a rule describes a pattern of behavior", "start": 1747.54, "duration": 4.66}, {"text": "but a pattern of behavior is a pattern of behavior, it's something that's acted out", "start": 1752.2, "duration": 4.18}, {"text": "so, there's the individual within the

games, roughly speaking, or stories", "start": 1764.48, "duration": 5.04}, {"text": "nested iside an overarching story, which is the fundamental culture", "start": 1769.52, "duration": 4.04}, {"text":
