I should tell you first about the genesis of this theory I suppose is the right way of putting it when I was about your age that was back in the early 80's or thereabouts and this was particularly true around 1984 but it was true before that too every generation has its worries real or imagined the primary worry for people of my generation was nuclear war and you know it was a genuine worry at one point many years later I went down to Arizona to visit an ICBM, a decommissioned ICBM nuclear missile silo and ICBM, intercontinental ballistic missile were, very large rockets right they flew at, they could fly half way around the world it was deep underground and behind very thick steel doors, it was light green you know that pastel green that everyone seemed to like in the 1950's it was like pastel green Star Trek console that's what it looked like and ah, so we went down out in the yard, it was in the desert,  out in the yard there was a very I would say magical object for lack of a better word and that was the nose cone for the ICBM and it was quite big about that big, about that high, pointed like the point of a bullet about  3/4 's of an inch thick, plastic you know kind of a resin and it was designed to melt on re-entry so that was just sitting there so that was fairly thought provoking, let's put it that way and then we went into the missile silo interestingly enough appended to the front of it, it had been decommissioned under Regan, by the way in the front of it there was a museum with artifacts from the 1980's featuring Reagan and Gorbachev meeting multiple times and it was staffed by these Southern these Americans from the South who were grandparent age and they were and they were just super friendly and you know , they were happy to be in the museum, and it was like going to visit your grandma's nuclear missile silo and so it was jarring you know, because it was obviously a portentous place, and yet it was conjoined with hospitality and welcoming it was surreal in that manner 
So the Pareto distribution governs all sorts of other things too, I mentioned it governs the popularity of books the sales of books but it also, it also characterizes the distribution of everything that people produce, so if you think of creative production of any sort, artistic production, industrial production it doesn't matter, almost everything fails and a few things succeed beyond anyone's wildest imagination Apples' a good example of that, you know I mean, the iPhone, they have their competitors but 
You can make a high IQ person stupider by not educating them up to the level of their possibility, but taking someone who has a low IQ trying to raise that, it's like if you can figure out how to do that well, you know, it's Nobel Prize time for you because people have tried that a lot, and most recently with those you know Luminosity, Lumosity games and that sort of thing, the evidence that those produce anything other than brilliant performances on the Lumosity game itself is basically zero. Well, they get to where the edge of production is faster so if you have a 1000 people and you rank order them by IQ the smart people are going to come up with the new ideas first and they are going to have more ideas, and they are going to strategize better, and, you know, with an IQ of 90, which is, 15% of the population, think about that, 15% of the population 
that is pretty much the threshold for reading instructions and being able to follow them so you know, and our society is increasing sophisticated  so it is by no means obvious you know 
a  bloody miracle, and it always works this insanely functional society that we have somehow managed to generate is it is incomprehensible to me that it exists so, Anyways back in the industrial, the end of the industrial revolution 
but it fell apart remarkably peacefully, and so here we are and we don't know what do with the pesky Russians, but at least there is no evidence that they are our mortal enemies for fundamental reasons of axiomatic presupposition and things are a lot better in the world despite what everyone tells you than they were 40 years ago, and they are so much better than they were 50 years ago that is absolutely staggering and that was enough pretty much put and end to everything and, that's a dangerous game, man, you know and not only because of intent, but also because of the possibility of accidental just an accident, you know just a mistake, or just someone whose a little crazier than you might want them to be you know, and you might think, well no one would want to bring about the destruction of the world  but that just means you don't know very much about Stalin because of all the people who lived in the 20th century who had power 
you know, at the edges, checking everything out they start out afraid they check everything out, they know where to hide, they now what's safe and they know that because they go somewehere and nothing happens, so then they assume that it is safe and they slowly, build up a neighborhood that they are comfortable with , you are certainly give him a wide berth, you are going to keep a distance between him and you. 
but  How many don't? 
, You are not required to believe what I am telling you, by the way 
What is all that? It's art, it's culture, music belongs in that category and like, what the hell, what about music, it's like everyone loves it, or almost everyone It's a mystery, you listen to music and it is very meaningful I mean music gets people through some pretty dark times, why? 
Well, what is it that is interesting? And why isn't that interesting? It's not obvious. 
It's like, what? really? Why? 
a little sister who's like three Well, it's because you can be broken hurt and destroyed 
writers of fiction It isn't necessarily the case you know what the hell it means, you don't know what music means but you know it doesn't stop you from listening to it 
That's what we are going to try and figure out.  because that is how people act 
No, it's Maps of Meaning Positive psyche...[laughter] It's definitely not that...[laughter] Why might you be villainous? In the Brothers Karamazov, that argument is laid out beautifully, there is a character, Alyosha, who is a monastery novitiate and not really a sparkling intellect but a very good person, and he has a brother Ivan, and Ivan is, a vicious genius and Ivan just takes Alyosha apart, and partly does that by telling a story about 
How clueless are you ? and maybe not at all, or ultimately gullible, you don't know, is it your fault? are you so clueless that just can't protect yourself or was the person malevolent in some subtle way that you failed to detect everything is up in the air not good, and this idea that human beings travel to the underworld and come back it's a really useful thing to understand because we do that all the time whenever we fail, it's like, whoop, down into the underworld for a while 
what if the reaction is extremely positive, like something that...like winning the lottery Do you also go into the stress response, or? and 
Wow! Well, to wish upon a star is to raise your eyes above the horizon and to focus on something transcendent that is beyond you to focus on the absolute we could say, to focus on the light that shines in the darkness Now, a star is 
Well great!  Who are you? 
but it activates the same system, so you have to aiming at something and you should be aiming at something that's realistic that you want that you could get, you know, like not easily because if it's easy, in some sense you have already got it it's got to push you , and that's part of the pleasure actually because there is two things that want to do when you are pursuing something that is important and one of them is to get the thing that is important but the other is make yourself better at pursuing things right, so so you can get both of those at the same time you're aiming at something and increasing your competence at the same time it's like, that's a good deal, that's a good deal and there is a lot of intrinsic meaning to be felt in that, and second half of the program you, you write out a plan for how you are going to do it and how you are going to keep yourself on track and you are going to write about why it would be good for you if you did this and why it would be good for your family and what possible benefits it would have to the comminuty and. So I am going to tell you about a bunch of stories, and I am going to try and explain what they mean and what I hope will happen is that the world of narrative will open up for you, and that and like I found that incredibly useful, it's incredibly useful
