this one's particularly complicated so
because with Piaget you enter a whole new domain of of axiomatic thinking
that's the right way to think about it say each of these people that were
discussing each of these theories comes out the construction of the world from a
different perspective and it's it's really fundamentally different it's
different way deep down at the level of fundamental assumptions and so Piaget
who's a who's probably the world's most famous developmental psychologist but
although he didn't consider himself a developmental psychologist he considered
himself a genetic epistemology and what that meant was that he was interested in
Paestum ology which is how knowledge structures work and genetic means
formulation of and so he was interested in how children formulate their
knowledge structures in the world and he was a constructivist because he believed
that human beings construct the they don't only construct the representations
of the world and it's deeper than that it's more like they construct the world
itself now it depends to some degree on what you think of as the world and of
course that's so there's a reality definition issue that's nested at the
bottom of this and it's a very complex one and so I'm going to have to walk you
through it piece by piece now Piaget was a genius he was he wrote a paper I
believe on mollusks when he was ten and had it published in a scientific journal
and he was offered the curatorship of a museum as a consequence of that and his
parents had to write the museum directors and tell them that he couldn't
curate the museum because he was only ten and so that gives you some idea
about Piaget and he's published many many many books and many of them haven't
been translated into English yet and so he was quite the he was quite the you
know large intelligence creature and he studied all sorts of things so I'm gonna 
a good example I mean you could use a
dull axe made of bronze and it's like well that would chop down the tree it'd
be a lot of work though and then maybe you replace that with a sharp steel axe
that's designed like a wedge so that you can really hack down a tree with it or
maybe you replace it with a saw and so the it's not like the bronze axe could
chop down the tree but the steel axe can do a better job in the saw can do even a
better job and so the way that Piaget thought about the transformation of
human knowledge structures from from infancy onward essentially was that
infants would produce a representation of the world that was sort of low
resolution but quite tool like it would work in the world but then as they
progressed the nature of those tools would become refined that sometimes
transform completely so some sometimes imagine that a child would use in a
sense a low resolution picture of something and then they would increase
its resolution as they filled in the details that would
be assimilation that's the page idea notion of assimilation you're using the
same basic theory but filling in the details and then now and then you'd have
to switch to another picture entirely and that would be more like
accommodation that's where you'd have to transform your internal structures
completely in order to properly represent an act within the world and so
that's the basic difference between accommodation and assimilation so
assimilation is like micro alterations and accommodation is transformation of
the knowledge structure itself and so that's part of so what khun pointed out
was that there'd be a set of facts and then there'd be an anomaly arise of some
sort so like at the end of the 19th century the only remaining anomaly was
at least one of the remaining anomalies was that no matter which direction you
shine a light beam in and no matter how fast the platform on which you're
standing is moving the light beam has exactly the same velocity which seems
impossible so you know if the earth is moving this way around the Sun and you
shine a light off the earth you'd expect the speed of light to be the speed of
light plus the speed of the earth and then if you shone it the other way then
you'd expect the speed of light to be the speed of light - the earth speed but
that isn't what happens no matter how fast the platform on which the person
shining the light is standing the speed of light is always the same to every
observer so and people kind of thought of that as that wasn't the only anomaly
but that was one of them thought of that is the only anomaly left
in physics at the end of the 19th century and turned out that was a bad
one how long there was some other ones as well like the fact that light tends
to behave as a wave and a particle more or less at the same time which doesn't
seem possible so there's a couple of things left over in Newtonian physics
that the Newtonian physics couldn't explain but by the end of the 19th
century there were famous scientists saying yeah well we got this all wrapped
up there's really nothing left to discover and then Along Came quantum
mechanics and Einstein Yin relativity and bang the whole world was like really
different and quantum mechanics is much more comprehensive theory of the world
then Newtonian physics all of the electronics you used wouldn't work if
quantum physics wasn't correct roughly speaking and so that little tiny anomaly
blew into something that knocked the slats out underneath from underneath the
entire axiomatic structure of Newtonian physics it showed it was wrong at its
fundamental levels even though it turned out to be a subset
a correct subset of something that was much broader and so you can kind of
think of that as that's what kids are doing as they progress they develop a
theory that accounts for a certain set of you could say fact but this is
another place it gets tricky and then they modify those and make them more and
more refined but now and then they have to under grow quite a transformation not
be a stage transition in Piaget and thought that that's the stage transition
idea and that would be akin in some sense to a kuhnian scientific revolution
now what Piaget is trying to state here is that because you there's this weird
problem with facts which is that they tend to transform across time you know
like if you go take a biology course right now in 20 years pretty much
everything you read you learned or very much of what you learned will turn out
to have been wrong and that's kind of weird because it isn't wrong right now
and you think well how can it be wrong in 20 years and that that's a really
complicated problem and in order to solve that you kind of have to think
about facts like tools instead of them as thinking about them as objective
independent realities because a bad tool can still work as a tool whereas a bad
fact just kills you stone dead and so there's any ways in any case that seems
to be a completely unnecessary phenomena Oh God
there's no reason for that that's just sheer spite as far as I can tell mm-hmm
okay so so here's one of psays propositions and and it is that because
facts flux in some sense across time you're looking for something that
doesn't change across time to call it a real fact and so what Piaget is trying
to point out in this let's call it introductory paragraph is that the one
thing that doesn't change is the manner in which people generate facts rather
than the facts themselves so the ultimate fact is a fact about the way
people generate facts all right and so psays theory in part is a is a theory
about how knowledge is acquired and transformed and so it's not that no it's
not a study of the knowledge itself it's a study of the process by which the
knowledge is generated and he believed that that process was unchanging at
least with regards to human beings and so you could think of the Piaget alien
genetic epistemological mystery as being how is it that people form and transform
representations of the world and one of 
his conclusions about that is that
there's a standard process and then the reason that I'm telling you about Piaget
right now is because as far as I can tell the standard Piaget daeun
description of the manner in which knowledge is acquired and transformed is
the same thing that's represented in the mythology of the shamanic transformation
which is that there's a state of being and then it's derp up disrupted by
something chaotic and there's a disintegration period and that's the
space between the stage transitions for for children in which time they're often
upset because their little theory about the world isn't learning it isn't
working anymore and then in that chaotic period they
adjust themselves to new anomalies and anomalies or what occur when you act in
the world and what you want to happen doesn't happen right because that means
there's something wrong with your knowledge structure if you act and then
something happens you don't want to happen something's wrong with the way
you're representing the world or you could say something's wrong with the
world but good luck with that although you know people can modify the world as
well as modifying their belief structures and people do that a lot but
so this the piagetian stage transition as far as I can tell is a micro case of
the broader idea of the the existence an orderly state its dissolution into a
chaotic state because something unexpected has occurred and then it's
retransfer Meishan into a more integrated state now Piaget would say
well the initial state and the chaotic state and the final state aren't the
ultimate realities the ultimate reality is the process of moving through those
stages and that's how people acquire knowledge and that's you could say
that's the central element of human beings and I would say that's a that's
another reason Tatian of the hero myth because the hero is the person who notes
uh normally notes something that's changed that's outside of explored
territory encounters it defeats it let's say or get something of value from it
and then recasts it into the world shares it with the community
restructures of the world and so that's the central story it's it's not the
central story of human beings but it's it's close enough for for our purposes
at the moment so okay so that's what Piaget is about how do human beings
encounter the world and and what happens when they
do that now the thing about the world for Piaget is it's also a complicated
place it's not exactly the set of it's not the set of all objective facts that
remain to be discovered because Piaget is a constructivist and he's more of a
pragmatist than he is precisely a scientific realist and so that's a
complicated thing very very complicated thing I don't know if any of you and
maybe this is completely irrelevant I don't know if any of you listened to my
argument with Sam Harris but Sam Harris is a scientific realist and I was trying
to make at least in part at Piaget Ian's point but he was having none of that
that's for sure but but Piaget makes the point and so you know I'm going to let
him speak in some sense as we proceed through this and and well you'll see why
he does what he does so if all knowledge is always in the state of development
and consists in proceeding from one state to a more complete and efficient
one so that that implies a hierarchy of states right that you move from one
knowledge structure to the next one which includes the previous one and is
better and it's better because it covers more territory that's how you know it's
better it does the same thing the old tool does plus some additional things so
it's a definition of better it's a good thing to have a definition of better and
worse all knowledge is always in the state of
development and consists in proceeding for one state to a more complete
deficient one evidently it is a question of knowing this development and
analyzing it with the greatest possible accuracy which is something I happen to
agree with but that's partly because I read Piaget and and I think I understand
what he meant and he's quite the thinker and so I'm gonna see if I can like clue
you in a little bit about this because it's it's well it's exceedingly complex
you know and most of the time when people talk about Piaget they just talk
about his surface experiments they don't talk about what he was actually up to
and what he was up to was well he was trying to figure out how people
represent the world and learned and that's not only it's not only that you
know this is another thing people don't know about Piaget is that he was trying
to reconcile the chasm between science and values that's what drove him through
his entire intellectual life he was attempting to bridge the gap between
science and religion that's another way of thinking about it and and that was
explicit he knew that that's why he did everything he did and so the thing
that's so cool about Piaget I think is that he actually started to provide what
you might think about as a rational basis for morality it's not exactly
rational that's the thing because it's rational rational belief like scientific
realism has a certain set of presuppositions at its core and Piaget
doesn't use those presuppositions to solve the problem get a problem so deep
the gap between what is and what ought to be that's the David Humes problem you
can't derive a naught from it is just because you know a bunch of things
doesn't give you an unerring guide to know what to do about those things
there's a gap there and Harris and people like him say that gap is illusory
but most philosophers including David Hume including Piaget these are
heavy-duty people including Heidegger would would disagree with that they
don't believe that that that that gap is non-existent and and and Harris believes
that you can nest values within science and and that's the proposition that he
continually puts forward like most of the so-called new atheists but it's a
hell of a lot more difficult to do than 
you think that's for sure and so anyway couple 
individuals certainly it produces
extinction of the individuals and the death of the group so as far as do all
would concerned 
massive complex 
up with that you know can tell in part because the more upset you get about something the more central
it is that that things about to your entire structure of belief and that's
one way of getting into that unconscious structure of belief from a
psychoanalytic perspective so what are the things that happens to me for
example as a therapist is I'll be talking to my clients and they'll be
talking about something difficult and all of a sudden they'll cry and they
often don't know why so I stopped them right there it's like something went
through your mind something happened and the cry indicates that you've moved
beyond your domain of competence out into the unknown world all of a sudden
into chaos what's that chaos what exactly happened and people you know
they're usually embarrassed that they cry but often make
remember what flitted through their mind and it's a represent it's a it's some
encounter with the chaos beyond their conceptual systems that produces that
emotional response and then we can dig into that find out oh that's a trauma
especially if it's more than a year - how fold and those can be of various
depths and profundity you know sometimes they're so bad that the person just
breaks down completely and they never put themselves together you know that's
when something's just walloped you it's hit you right at the bottom of your
axiomatic structures so to speak right at the trunk but when you're doing
therapy with people and you watch how they respond emotionally you look for
those tiny eruptions of negative emotion and those are like holes in their
conceptual structure and those have to be sewed up by their man you in the
process of dialogue you figure out okay there was a bit of unexplored territory
there that manifested itself it produced an emotional response in you that
indicates that you've reverted in some 
that would be the
Freudian interpretation now we have to figure out what it was that that's in
that hole what caused that tear and then we have to go back and articulate it and
analyze and study it until we can sew it up and then and art and and get to you know not a danger that's what the mouse is first danger not danger 

transformation so that's a very classic piagetian problem so let's say you give 
you
 can lift them right up and it's sort of well clinging ape
you know because chimpanzee infants cling to their mother for like five
years and so without reflux is still there so the kid comes into the world
born with these simplistic low resolution procedures that enable it to
get a foothold on the world and then out of that the child emerges and that's so
the constructivist idea is that well it isn't like you have your heads full of
fully developed axiomatic structures and it isn't that you get all your knowledge
from the world it's that you have a bit of structure there to begin with that
gives you a toehold on the world and then you act in the world and as you act
you generate information and out of that information you make the structures
inside of you and you make the world that's a constructivist idea is that you
take whatever's there this tremendous complexity and you sort it into you and
the world and so and so that that goes back to that William James idea about
that initial chaos and it's a hard 
conflict it's a hard hard concept to
grasp because that isn't really how we think you know we think that there's an
objective world and there's a subjective world and that the objective world is
just there and the subjective world is maybe a subset of that but that is not 
piagetian presupposition it's not a presupposition of phenomenologist sin
general who we'll talk about later but so here's one example of how to
think about this in a sense it's like you know you think 
ideas in embodied form 
 
like overnight so and they're imitating
the hell out of us right now too because we're teaching them how to understand us
every second of every day the net is learning what we're like it's watching
us it's communicating with us it's imitating us and it's gonna know it
already knows in some ways more about us than we know about ourselves you know
there's lots of reports already of people getting pregnancy ads or ads for
infants sometimes before they know they're pregnant but often before
they've told their families and the way that that happens is the net is watching
what they're looking at and inferring with its artificial intelligence and so
maybe you're pregnant that's just tilting you a little bit right to
interest in things that you might not otherwise be interested in the net
tracks that then it tells you what you're at what you're after it does that
by offering an advertisement so it's reading your unconscious mind
so well so that's what's happening so all right so what's the motive for
development dis equilibria that's a Piaget lien term well this is a
life is suffering idea it's like why learn something cuz you're wrong who
cares it makes you suffer you care so you know if you run out a little scheme
in the world a little action pattern you don't get what you want if you're
especially if you're two years old you burst into tears and cry and why is that
it's because you don't know what you don't know where you are and you don't
know what you're doing it's like time for some negative emotion
it indicates that you're wrong and that's terrible in some sense because it
all it almost always means that to learn requires pain now I don't believe that
exactly because people are curious you know and to go out and be curious and to
learn new things can be very exciting and so what it seems to be is that
there's there's a rate of learning that's too fast and that hurts you
that's what makes you cry but if you get the rate just right you're just opening
up enough novelty so that you can benefit from the possibilities that
gives you a dopamine kick fundamentally you can benefit from the possibilities
without being overwhelmed by the by the unexpected element of it and you can
tell when that's happening and this is one of the coolest things as far as I'm
concerned this is and I learned this partly from Piaget it's like you know in
order to withstand suffering let's say your life has to have some meaning okay
well that that means a bunch of things it means that part of the way that you
overcome suffering is by making the suffering into something meaningful and
I don't mean that metaphysically I mean it technically you made a mistake it
causes you suffering you learn something about it you don't make that mistake
again it's real adaptation it's not it's not
defense against death anxiety or something like that it's real adaptation
but more importantly the reality that you learn through pain is the oldest
reality will say it's it's really old it's as old as nervous systems and so
you've adapted so that you've learned to transform your knowledge structures in a
way that will minimize your potential exposure to future pain
they at a rate you can tolerate or maybe even enjoy and so what's happening is
you don't actually like being static it bores you but you don't like being
thrown into chaos it's like no a little bit of that's fine what you want is you
want to be opening up your knowledge structures on the periphery to
transformation voluntary transformation that's voluntary exploration and letting
those things manifest a little bit of interesting chaos and so you have a
little bit you put a little feeler out there that you're willing to let die and
it comes apart and you gather a bit of information it comes back together
stronger and you do that all the time if you're if you're smart and you're
looking for new information foraging for new information and that means you keep
taking little bits of yourself apart and reconstructing them and overtime that
keeps you alive and active you know part of the reason you're alive is because
you're dying all the time right all the cells in your body like if they don't
die you get cancer and that that's it you're done you're a very very tight
balance between death and life at every every single level including the
cognitive level and it's not that fun to learn something because you have to kill
something you already know in order to learn it that's another piece yet in
observation because you're always interpreting something within a
structure and if that interpretation is wrong even in a microwave you have to
kill that structure and it's a biological structure it actually hurts
to kill it but maybe you can generate something new in its stead and if you
get the dynamic right let the rate right then you find that exhilarating not
painful and that's and that's well you can tell when you're doing that as far
as I can tell you can tell when you're doing that because you're engaged in the
world in a meaningful way and what your nervous system is doing is signaling to
you that you're not in a static place that's death you're not in a chaotic
place that's death your balance between the static and the chaotic such that the
static structures are transforming at exactly the right rate to keep you on
top of the environmental transformations and so you're surfing you know in Hawaii
the surfers surfing was sacred well that's why it's like do you can you tell
someone how to surf well you can't because they have to go out there and
dynamically interact with the wave but they can stay on top of the wave and
that's what you have to do and if you're
staying on top of the wave properly then it's exhilarating and that's the kind of
meaning that that it rejuvenates you literally it makes you able to tolerate
the suffering in life and it's not metaphysical precisely it's because that
is what you're doing at that moment you're you're overcoming your
limitations and of course that's what 
you have to do in order to to know and
to learn because you want to be doing both of those things at the same time
that's what you do when you play a game properly your parents say it doesn't
matter whether you win or lose this is a PSAT and observation it's how you play
the game what does that mean well it means that you should play the game in a
manner that increases the probability that you're going to be invited to play
many games in the future perfect so you master the skills of the game but at the
same time you master a set of meta skills which is the skills that remain
constant across transforming sets of games and that's what it means to play
fair that's a bloody basis of morality as far as Piaget was concerned it's so
damn smart you know because you think all interactions have this game-like
quality they're sort of bounded and but there are commonalities across all the
games and you want to extract out the commonalities and you want to learn to
inhabit the universe that's made out of the commonalities between games and 
that's what it means to be a good person roughly speaking you know it varies to
some degree from culture to culture obviously because each culture is a game
unto itself but there's something that transcends that that's the nature of
games across game contexts and you know that you know that because you can tell
the difference between a game and and something that isn't a game instantly
everyone knows and it's not like there's only one kind of game there's hockey say
and there's there's a world of warcraft I know it's way out of date but so am I
so it's not surprising so but the fact that those things are very very
different in many many ways doesn't stop you from identifying the underlying
commonalities you know they're games and they're they're like stories in a sense
so and that's a piagetian that's a piagetian observation very very smart
so why do you develop well it's because your your previous idea their your
previous frame micro frame let's say doesn't fit the circumstance and so
something happens it you go like this what's up well the world isn't what you
thought and there's something wrong with your knowledge structure this is partly
what's makes Piaget a pragmatist you see the pragmatist American school of
philosophy William James and his followers they knew that we had bounded
knowledge we don't have infinite knowledge and so they thought well that
means we can't really be right about anything because we're definitely wrong
and so how is it that you can operate in the world given that you're always wrong
 

because every time you reappear it's an it's a miracle unis watch babies it's so
funny like you go like this and they go then you talk back holding like they're
so happy they're just overjoyed and then you take yourself away and they're like
 what's going on what's going on bang you reappear they don't have a real memory 
another one that tells it to shut up
that's sort of what happens when you're addicted to drugs
so cocaine bathes the tissue that was active just before you took the cocaine
with dopamine and so that gets stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger
and so you're basically building a cocaine seeking monster in your head and
that's all it wants and it has rationalizations and it has emotions and
it has motivations and it's alive but it wants one thing and the problem is once
you build that thing especially if you nail it a couple of hundred times with
the powerful dopaminergic agonist like cocaine that thing is one vicious
monster and it's alive and it's in there and you can't get it to go away the only
thing you can do is build another structure to shut it up but the problem
is is that as soon as you get stressed it interferes with that new structure
and the old thing comes popping back up not good I wouldn't recommend it and the
faster acting those dopaminergic agonists are cocaine is a good example
but so is math the faster they hit you which is often why people inject them
instead of snorting them say the faster that transformation from steady state to
dopaminergic path the bigger the kick is and so you know so speed of introduction
of the substance matters which is why you drink shots instead of drinking say
wine or beer because alcohol has you know very similar very similar effects
so all right so if you get what you want
well then you feel good but not only do you feel good but the frame itself is
validated and if you don't get what you want well then not only do you not get
what you want but the frame itself starts to come apart at the seams and 
reappears Yeti and claim so so let's
think about emotional regulation because this is a really good schema for 
understanding emotional regulation how upset should you get and how do you
calculate it because if you make a mistake you wake up in the morning in
your side hurts okay you it's the first symptom of pancreatic cancer you're dead
in six months 100% chats or you know you pulled a
muscle well which is it you might say well the chances of the pancreatic
cancer or low but they're not zero and like infinite times any proportion is a
very large number so you might be thinking why don't you just have a
screaming fit any time ever any little thing happens to you which is exactly
what happens by the way if you're two years old right that is what you do so
and it's because you don't know you don't know like things fell apart 
level of resolution that you can manage
so let's say and that's what you're doing with the kid
it's like clean up your room be a good person it's like no they don't know any
about anything about that but they do know how to pick up a teddy bear and
then maybe you think cleaning up your room is a hundred things like that and
so you have to teach the child each one of those hundred things and then they
learn this is the scheme they learn what's the same across all of those
different actions that's clean right pick up the teddy bear put away the
Legos make your bed what those have nothing in common really like the motor
outputs completely different but they fall under the heading of clean but 
unless you fill the heading of clean with all the subordinate categories of
the action perception sequences that make up clean kid can't do it and so
partly what you're doing by attending to your child constantly is noticing where
they are in the construction of this hierarchy and they start way down here
right and so that's why you play peekaboo for example it's like they can
do that and you can you know you interact with them because you can watch
you do a little something and if they respond you got some sense that you're
you're at the same level and kids and playgrounds do that with each other
right away so if you if you see two three-year-olds
together say they're fairly sophisticated for three-year-olds what
they'll do is they'll start playing a little primitive game with each other
like door like a dog you know what a dog does what it wants to play it kind of
goes like that and and that's what kids do and that's what adults do too it's a
plague it's play it if it tastes like I'm ready
but you're smiling it's not like I'm ready it's and so you can tell the
difference between a play fight and play and kids can too so it's an invitation
to play and so if you're interacting with your little kid they got that play
circuit man that thing's in there like when they're from birth I think because
you can play with a kid right from birth at least something like peekaboo and so
you're on the same wavelength fundamentally and then you interact with
them and you see if they're following what you're doing is what I'm doing when
I'm lecturing more or less I'm watching you guys and seeing if we're more or
less in the same shared space you know and we want the space to be expanding
because if it's just staying the same well you might as well play whatever you
play on your computer it has to be expanding at the same time that's
optimal and so when you're playing with your kid you put them on that
developmental edge where they're undoing and then rebuilding their little skills
you know you can do that like I had this memory from when I was a little kid a
while back and I remembered I used to go over to these peoples house with my
father and my mom and it was way up in northern Alberta and these people were
Russian immigrants as children of Russian immigrants and they had a
farmhouse way way out in the country way out by the way there where the railroad
actually ended if you walk north from there you'd walk until you hit like
southern Europe without fun running into another person it was way the hell out
in the middle of nowhere and anyways they had a nice house it's like a warm
house you know they had three kids and they were way older than me but it was a
real fun comfortable place to go and I used to sit in the living room with my
father and his friend whose name was Nick and Nick was a really playful guy I
really liked him he was like my surrogate grandfather and I used to I
don't think I was more than about three I'd sit there and I try to hit his foot
with my fist and he would be talking to my dad you know and my dad would say
Jordan don't bother Nick and Nick would say well he's not really bothering me
and his dad was checking it out to see
