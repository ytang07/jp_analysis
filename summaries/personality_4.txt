so I think the best way to continue to
walk you through the thinkers that we're planning to cover is to do that with
examples they stick better and they're more interesting and it's very difficult
to understand you outside of a narrative context 
lawyers and lawyers and physicians 
on thus spake Zarathustra which is about
I've got this wrong it's somewhere between 700 and 1100 pages long and it
only covers the first third of the book and thus spake Zarathustra is actually
quite a short book and so well so you can imagine how much you had to know
about Nietzsche to derive that many words out of that few words and
Nietzsche was a well an absolute absolute genius and Jung was actually
trying to answer the question that Nietzsche posed fundamentally which is 
why part of the reason why it's incorrect historically to consider him a
Freudian he was so nietzsche basically stated let's say explicitly that
scientific empiricism / rationalist had resulted in the death of the
mythological tradition of the west roughly speaking that's Nietzsche's
comment on the death of God and in that comment he also said that the fact that
God was dead was going to produce tremendous idiy a tional and social
historical upheavals that would result in the deaths of millions of people 
is the fundamental question the day is morning 
thing that updates that right you need
it to orient yourself in the world you need it to orient yourself among other
people but your eye and your capacity to pay attention especially to what you
don't want to pay attention to is the thing that continually updates that
model exactly as Piaget laid out with children so and all of that's packed
into the imagery in the first you know a few minutes of this movie and that's
actually why it relies on imagery why this isn't just a lecture by a
psychologist you know when you go to see the movie it's because the images they
say a picture is worth a thousand words but and there's thousands of pictures in
this movie obviously but maybe a picture is worth more words than you can
actually use to describe it if the pictures is is profound enough and we
have many many pictures like that any deeply symbolic picture
is virtually inexhaustible in terms of its of semantically with regards to its
explanation images are very very dense so anyways the animals all gather now
the animals are also in representations from the Freudian perspective and the it
is the part of your psyche from the Freudian perspective that's animalistic
and and and full of of implicit drives sexual and aggressive in particular as
far as Freud was concerned and that's because those two drives say unlike
thirst or hunger are much more difficult to integrate into proper social being
and tend to be excluded and left unconscious and so a lot of Freudian
psychology and I would say psychology in general is focused on the integration of
sexual impulses and aggressive impulses into the psyche I would also add to that
anxiety because anxiety is also a major problem anxiety and negative emotion
that's pain like is also a major problem for people and so the animals represent
those it'd like impulses that have to be organized hierarchically before you can
become an integrated being and precisely the piagetian manner right because
Piaget would say well the child comes into the world with reflexes and maybe a
more modern psychologists would also concentrate on the implicit motivations
and those have to be organized inside the child into some kind of hierarchy of
unity before the child can organize him or herself into the broader unity of the
state and that's basically what's being represented here and so so Zazu the eyes
of the king comes to check out the King and that's uh what's his name what's the
King's name Mufasa yeah and he's a very regal looking person lion and he stands
up straight and tall and that means that he's high in serotonin because serotonin
governs posterior flexion and if so if your dominant and near the top of
hierarchies you tend to expand so that you look bigger than then you could if
you shrunk down and so if you're low dominant person you wander around like
this so that you look small and weak and you don't pose a threat to anybody but
if you're at the top you expand yourself so that you can command the space and
that's why he has that particular kind of regal posture and if you look at his
facial expression you see that it's quite severe it like he's he's capable
of kindness but he's also harsh and judgmental and that's what
society is like that's what the super-ego is like and what that means is
that he's integrated his aggression and I've seen this happen in my clinical
clients when they come in and they're too agreeable they look like Simba looks
later in the movie when he's an adolescent and he's sort of like a deer
in headlights everything is coming in and nothing is coming out but when the
person integrates their shadow and gets the aggressive part of themselves
integrated into their personality their face is hardened and if you look at
people you can tell because the people who are too agreeable look childlike and
innocent and the people who well a hyper aggressive person will look you know
mean and cruel but uh let's see if that's good that's still working so but
I've seen people's face changes change face change in the course of therapy men
and women so and what happens is they start to look more mature and it's it's
more like they're they're judging the world as well as interacting with it
properly once they integrate that more disagreeable part of them it's very very
necessary that's part of the incorporation of the Union shadow or the
incorporation of the unconscious from a Freudian perspective but old Musa Musa
there he's already got that he's already got that covered so and he's capable of
obviously he can smile and he's full capable of the full range of expressions
but he's a tough looking character and and now this baboon here who's supposed
to be basically just a fool when the story was first written he turned into
what's essentially a shaman across time and so he represents the self from the
Union perspective now the self is everything you could be across time so
you imagine that there's you and there's the potential inside you whatever that
is you know and potential is an interesting idea because it's represents
something that isn't yet real yet we act like it's real because people will say
to you you should live up to your potential and that potential is partly
what you could be if you interacted with the world in a manner that would gain
you the most information right because you build yourself out of the
information in the piagetian sense but it's deeper than that - because we know
that if you take yourself and you put yourself in a new environment new genes
turn on in your nervous system they encode for new proteins and so you're
full of biological tential that won't be realized unless
you move yourself around in the world in two different challenging circumstances
and that'll turn on different circuits so it's not merely that you're
incorporating information from the outside world in the constructivist
sense it's that by exposing yourself to different environments you put different
physiological demands on on yourself all the way down to the genetic level and
that manifests new elements of you and 
so one of the things that happens to
people and this is a very common cultural notion is that you should go on
a pilgrimage at some point to somewhere central and that would be say like the
rock in the Pride Rock and the Lion King because you take yourself out of your
dopey little village and that's just a little bounded you that everyone knows
and that isn't very expanded and then you go somewhere dark and dangerous to
the central place and while you do that you have adventures and they tough on
you and pull more out of you like partly because you're becoming informed which
means in formation it means you're becoming more organized at every level
of analysis but there's also more of you too and so that's a very classic idea an old
idea that the way to full maturity is to find what you lost as a child and regain
it it's a brilliant idea and that that that echoes through mists all
over the world and that means you have to regain your capacity once you're
disciplined and you know how to do something you have to regain your
capacity for play and sort of for wide-eyed wonder and that's maybe the
childlike part of your spirit and the reintegration of that childlike part
with the adult grown-up part Reviva Faiz the adult grown-up part and allows the
child to manifest itself in a disciplined way in the world and so
that's all being hinted that there and then they showed the shaman shows the
baby the newborn hero to the crowd and it's very cool what happens in the movie
all the animals spontaneously Neil and I can give you an example of that kind of
spontaneous action in a crowd it's imagine you're watching off
gymnastics performance right and and it's like at a high level world-class
performance and someone comes out there and they do this routine that's just
dead letter-perfect you know and they stop and everybody claps like mad right
and it's perfect and so then the next contestant comes
out and they're basically in real trouble because you know this person
just got nine point seven out of ten and it was perfect so how do you beat
perfect and so will they come out there 
and then you watch them and you're right
on the edge of your seat because what you see them do is something
extraordinarily disciplined just like the last person did but they push
themselves into that zone that's just beyond their discipline capacity and very
 
we
live in this pyramid we're at the top there's a domain of light around it
that's explored territory outside of that there's explore unexplored 
territory and that's partly the unconscious because you fill it with
fantasy and it's partly what you just don't know and then Mufasa tells Simba
and it's sort of like God telling Adam and even in the Garden of Eden not to
eat the apple Mufasa tells Simba there's that this outside place that's dark
that's not part of your kingdom and you should not go there and that's really
interesting because Simba doesn't even know about that place yet and so Mufasa
is doing something very contradictory there it's like telling him that it
exists and and heightening his curiosity 
but also saying that he should go there
almost ensuring that that's exactly what Simba is going to do you see this in the
Pinocchio movie to where Pinocchio is planning to jump into the ocean to go
get Geppetto from the underworld and he's following his conscience is along
with him Jiminy Cricket and the cricket is warning him about all
the dangers that he'll face down there and telling him that he will be fish
food personally and while he's doing that
Pinocchio ties a knot around his donkey tail around a rock so he can sink and
and the little cricket helps him tie the knot so well he's warning him about the
adventure he's going to undertake at the same time he's encouraging him to do it
and there's that paradoxical thing which is that if you go outside what you know
it will cause a fall because it'll damage your knowledge structures and
you'll go down into chaos and that can really destroy you so you should
do it but by the same token if you do do it and you do it successfully then the
new you that are' arises can be stronger and more complete than the previous you 
so you should do it and you shouldn't do it and that's anyone sensible says look
don't bother right but sensible isn't enough that's the thing you have to also
be not sensible enough in order to live and your typical hero and Harry Potter
is a really good example is always a rule breaker always but he you know the
rules he breaks are like there's judicious nough speaking the hero breaks
a rule in the service of a higher good but he's still breaking the rules and
that's what puts them outside the boundary of the social of the social
establishment so now at this point Simba also gets introduced to scar and that
that that has two meanings one is that scar is the tyrannical element of the
state and so as a child when you're being socialized you encounter
