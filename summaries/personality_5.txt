so we'll continue with our union
analysis of the Lion King today we ended at the point where remember Mufasa had
taken Simba up to the top of Pride Rock and described to him the fact that his
kingdom essentially constituted everything that the light touched and
you can think about that as the domain of the roughly speaking of the great
father with the domain of the great mother on the outside of that being
symbolically equivalent to the underworld or to death or to nature all
of those things seem to be approximately equally true and he forbade Simba from
going to investigate what was beyond the confines of the light and in some sense
that's exactly what a tradition does for you it because the tradition is
precisely what defines the domain of the light and to be moral from the
perspective of the tradition it's akin to playing a piagetian game but only
adhering to the rules you know how Piaget described the fact that when kids
first master a game they learned they learn how to act it out and then they
learn what the rules are and then they regard the rules in some sense as sacred
you can't go outside the rules and then later in moral development if they get
to that stage then they start to recognize themselves also as formulators
of the rule or formulators of the game and culture tells you don't go beyond
the rules that's the definition of morality within the box of culture and
you don't go outside of that and so that's why Mufasa plays that particular
role and it's wise because if you go outside the domain of what you already
understand then it's dangerous out there clearly it's dangerous out there but the
downside of that particular message and this is perhaps this is the mythological
reason why Mufasa isn't as aware as he could be of scar
you know his knowledge is bounded and he's no I'm not aware enough of what
lies outside of that in this realm let's say of death and destruction and so scar
is he is able to overcome his his brother one you see this sort of thing
happening to people very frequently for example who developed post-traumatic
stress disorder and one of the things that's not as well
known about post-traumatic stress disorder as might be known is a it
happens to you if you encounter an experience that sort of blows out the
axioms of your knowledge system that's one way of looking at it it's so
unexpected that you can't account for it within the confines of this of the
system that you're using to interpret the world that often happens to people
when they encounter something that's truly malevolent and that can be within
them or it can be in the form of someone else who is genuinely out to hurt them
they're often people who develop PTSD are often but not always somewhat naive
and they're not aware of the full catastrophe of the world that might be
one way of looking at it and then they encounter someone who's truly out to
hurt them and they can detect that even in in the way the person's face looks or
they encounter a part of them that's much more malevolent than they had ever
imagined it could possibly be and then they do something terrible and then they
don't know what to do about it so delay or the the Canadian General
wrote a book called shake hands with the devil and it was about what happened to
him in Rwanda when he was stationed there as a UN warrior or a UN soldier
and I mean Dallaire was not naive but what he encountered was truly malevolent
and it just blew him into pieces and and that that's what happens and so there's
real utility and staying within the bounded domain but the problem is is
that there may be information that's outside of that domain that you
absolutely need to know and so part of the problem with being alive is that you
have to continually determine how much you're going to maintain your stability
and how much you're going to explore and you have to explore because the stable
part of you gets outdated but if you explore too much or too too unwisely
then you can encounter things that flip you upside down it's actually one of the
problems with being high and trade openness especially if you're also high
in neuroticism because if you're open you're creative you're always looking
for for ideas that are outside of your current systematic way of thinking but
if you're high in eroticism so you parents a lot of anxiety and emotional
pain and that sort of thing you can continually upset your own apple cart
now the other thing that you might want to think about this is really useful as
far as I'm concerned is you might want to think about this politically and
we've been doing a lot of work I'm gonna have one of my graduate students
actually come and talk to you about the work we've been doing on personality and
Paul and political belief so what happens with political belief is that if
you're high in openness and low in conscientiousness you tend to be a
liberal the openness being the particularly important part of that and
if you're low in openness and high in conscientiousness especially orderliness
you tend to be a conservative now it's kind of strange because openness and
conscientiousness aren't very highly correlated so it's not obvious why those
two traits would combine to determine political belief and and the
relationship is actually quite strong between temperament and political belief
if you measure political belief comprehensively but it seems to me that
the fundamental distinction and this is the political game at least along the
liberal conservative axis this boils down to one thing it boils down to how
open borders should be compared to how close they should be and you know you
can see that reflected for example in the attractiveness of Trump to a large
part of the general population because he's going to close the borders build a
wall and fortify the borders and conservatives like that they like to
have borders between things stay tight and they don't even care if it's state
borders or political borders or town borders or ethnic borders or borders
between ideas or borders between sexual 
identities conservatives like to have
things stay in the damn box where they belong
partly because they're orderly and partly because they're lone openness
they don't get any real they're not interested in what happens if you free
up your conceptions all they see in that is the probability of disorder whereas
liberals who are high in openness and low and conscientiousness slash
orderliness they get a real charge out of letting things out of the box so that
they can creatively interplay now the issue is who's correct and the answer is
you don't know because the environment underneath the political landscape moves
and so sometimes the right answer is tighten up the borders and fortify and
sometimes the right answer is no no loosen things up because everything's
good to static and tight and we need more
information and the dialogue that occurs in the political landscape with this is
 
against him fundamentally and that was everything changes but you have to bring forward some structures from the past so 
gonna hang him he told the guy who was
going to hang him he said hurry up you who's your bastard I could kill 12 men
in the time it takes you to hang me and that's exactly the sort of person he was
and he made friends with this physician in the in the prison who he thought was
like the first person who ever did something nice for him gave him a dollar
for cigarettes if I remember correctly and the physician encouraged him to
write his autobiography and so he did and it's it's available and so if you
want a view because you know you you always think of people you think well
people have good intentions you know that you especially think that if you're 
naive and agreeable so all of you who are sitting there out there thinking
people have good intentions you're probably high in agreeableness but
that's not always the case people can have very dark motivations
that are fully conscious and very well elaborated and panzram was know he was
smart and his book is very well written and he tells you exactly why he thought
the way he thought and so it's a good glimpse of exactly this sort of thing
where you can get to if you want to by brooding on your specific misfortune you
know and his his basic credo was that human beings were so reprehensible that
they should just be eliminated and believe me that's what he was trying to
do and these people who do terrible things like the Columbine shooters
that's exactly what for black of a better word they're possessed by its
sheer malevolence and the Columbine kids had a much more spectacular catastrophe
planned than the one that actually occurred and they knew it was going to
be a full-blown media circus and lots of these people who engage in those sorts
of mass murders they know about the other mass murders and they're engaged
in a competition and the competition is who can do the most brutal thing the
fastest something like that so you can't just be thinking about people who've you
know who have good intentions but have somehow gone wrong if you ever meet
someone who isn't like that and you think that you're just a tree with ripe
fruit to be plucked so you don't want to be in that situation you have to keep
your eyes open and so anyways that's basically what's encapsulated in this
part of the story now the hyenas go after the little lion obviously but they
managed to escape it's very malevolent scene and Mufasa
shows up at the last minute to rescue them so and you know that there's also a
mythological trope there which is that if you go outside your domain of
confidence and you encounter something you don't understand the first thing
that you're going to do is look to the knowledge structures that you already
possess to explain it right and that's the you could say from a symbolic
perspective that that's the manifestation of the father as of course
that's what you're going to do and you you know what's really interesting
- is because I've had a lot of clients who've had PTSD and and without
exception every single one of them was induced by one form of malevolence or
another they have to develop a very sophisticated philosophy of good and
evil to get out of it because they have a worldview in which those things don't
really exist there's no such thing as pure malevolence well that's fine unless
you encounter it and then as soon as you encounter it as soon as you encounter it
you won't know what to do and then you won't be able to get on with your life
you'll do nothing but think about that and think about it and think about it
and think about it'll disrupt your sleep it'll put you into a permanent state of
preparation for action because the part of your brain that's detected that which
in my estimation by the way is the same part at least in part that detects
snakes it's the same damn circuit once it's seen something like that it is not
gonna let you go till you figure it out and that's basically what post-traumatic
stress disorder is and you know to some degree each of you will have experienced
that maybe not all of you in here but many of you and you can tell that so if
you go back and you think about your past and you have any memory that's more
than about eighteen months old and when you think about it it produces a fair
bit of negative emotion then that's like a minute that's like a place where
there's a mini post-traumatic stress problem and what's happened you remember
I showed you that hierarchy moving from tiny motor actions all the way up to
high order abstractions well you can imagine say you have good person at the
top and and you you kind of use that that scenario to construe other people
people are basically good well then you run into someone who is not good and
boom the whole bloody system comes tumbling down because it's violated that
highest order axiom so that's post-traumatic stress disorder
if something has violated an axiom that's more differentiated you know
closer to the actual motor output not quite so high in the abstraction chain
then all it does is wipe out that part of the structure it doesn't wipe out the
whole thing and you can tell if you have holes in your perceptual value structure
by checking to see if you have memories that are still alive in a negative way
that are old enough so that they should have been incorporated into your
personality and so one of the things you can do
you're doing one of the exercises that's on myself authoring site you guys do the
personality analysis but there's another program there called the that's called
the past authoring where you write down an autobiography and thinking through
these things that have happened to you in your past that are negative is a good
way of making them go away and thinking them through kind of means you have to
figure out what happened right and then you sort of have to figure out how to
make it not happen again what you're trying to derive is some kind of causal
analysis how is it that I was put into a situation where I was made vulnerable
you know and that could be well because 
you're only four and you couldn't
protect yourself and now it's time to update that because you're a fully
functioning adult or there may be things that you have to think through and
change in your own personality or attitudes that you've been holding on to
since you were tiny I have this client once and she came in and told me that
she had been sexually assaulted by her older brother and she told me the story
and I kind of got the impression that maybe she was like eight and he was like
17 or something like that and she was about 27 when she came and talked to me
and then I found out by further questioning that she was 4 and he was 6
and I thought she still had this story in her head of her being tormented by 
this older person right that's how she told the story and what I told her was
well look another way of looking at this is that you two were very badly
supervised children because I mean he was 6 for God's sake you know he's a
little kid that doesn't mean that what happened to her was any less traumatic
but but he wasn't 17 right if the story was different than the one she had in
her head and you know by the time she left after we had that conversation it
was clear that the way that she was construing the experience had radically
shifted and it was very interesting because you know you think of the past
as fixed but and it is in some sense but the reason you remember the past isn't
to make an objectively accurate record of the past it's so that you can use the
information in the past to prepare you for the future and your mind won't leave
you alone unless that has happened so if you've encountered something that's
negative and you don't know why and you don't know what to do about it if that
have again in the future then that will stay
with you and I think one of the things that does too is it increases your
overall physiological load is actually physiologists who've been talking about
this I can't remember the damn phrase but you could imagine that your mind is
doing something like this all the time it's it's it's it's got a record in some
sense of your autobiographical experiences and 

young wrote a lot about was astrology strangely enough slash astronomy and one
of young contentions this is a very interesting one was that because the
night sky was completely unknown people could project their fantasies into it
and that's what they did without with astrology so astrology is this
cumulative fantasy that's going on in the in that roughly speaking in the deep
unconscious projected on to the sky and so if you analyze old astrological
writings what you're really doing is analyzing old fantasies and because of
that you could develop some insight into the structure of the mind and so he did
the same thing with alchemy and his later writings which are very very
difficult to understand but extremely worthwhile ok so anyways back to the to
the hellish domain now I told you that that domain that's outside of knowledge
you could think about that as the underworld or you can think about it as
nature the negative element of nature in particular and so I mentioned that one
element of that is hellish and that's exactly what the movie explains next it
does exactly that we go back out to this domain that scar the adversary or 
that was published in PLoS ONE about
three years ago showing that brilliant study should have got much more
attention showing that if you went around and looked and sampled political
attitudes in different countries or even within the same country what you found
was that the higher the prevalence of infectious diseases the higher the
probability of totalitarian political attitudes at the local level and you can
imagine well what happens if there's infectious diseases is you want to put
borders around everything you don't want free movement between ideas or people
because that's partly how the disease spreads you're going to have much more
strict sexual rules for example because that's a great way for diseases to be
transmitted and before Hitler went on his rampage against the non-aryans he'd
cleaned up all the factories and like he went in there and fumigated them it was
part of the law he went on a public health campaign to get rid of
tuberculosis and he got rid of the bugs in the factories as well he used cyclone
B that's an insecticide and that's the gas that he used in the gas chambers
eventually so first it was the bugs in the rats and then it was people who were
then it was euthanasia that was the neck move and forced you euthanasia and the
the rationale for that was compassion by the way just so you all know it's it's
it's merciful to put these people who are burdensome to themselves and their
families and the state who are living second-rate lives its merciful to
euthanize them and that was a huge campaign in Germany it was after that
that the more racial purifications began and so that's the disgust thing that's
unbelievably important it's it's it's because lots of times people think that
conservatives are more anxiety sensitive than liberals and that's why they're
closed in terms of their ideas that doesn't look right
first of all conservatives are less neurotic than liberals although the
effect isn't that big so it doesn't look and they actually are there they score
higher in measures of well-being the most unhappy people are liberal men by
the way so but you know people are often accused if they're conservative of being
fearful and that's why they you know suppress other people's viewpoints but
that doesn't look right it's low openness and high orderliness and that
looks like it's associated with disgust and that looks like it's associated with
something called the extended immune system which is the proclivity of people
to to keep themselves away from potential sources of contamination it's
really terrifying because one of the things people often said about Germany
was that you know it was a very civilized country and yet it descended
into barbarity but conscientiousness is a very good
predictor of long-term success and so you could say well conscientious
societies are more civilized but they're also more orderly and that makes them
more discussed sensitive and so what it might have easily might have easily been
in Germany was that it was an excess of civilization rather than its lack that
produced exactly these consequences and that's a far more frightening
proposition and one that's I believe much more likely to be true Hitler
bathed four times a day and he was also an admirer of willpower so he could
stand like this for eight hours in the back of a car and the thing about
conscientious people is they're very willpower oriented and so if you're
unfortunate enough to be sick chronically in the house of someone
who's conscientious if it's a mental illness you're more
likely to relapse because the conscientious person is going to be
judgmental and they're going to say to you if you're schizophrenic they're
going to say well if you just organize yourself and get up in the morning and
try a little harder you could overcome this which is of
course true except you can't because you're schizophrenic and so the pressure
put on you by the anger and the contempt is going to increase the probability
that you'll relapse so orderly people are very judgmental and you know
orderliness is very highly associated with things like anorexia and the
anorexic is basically someone who's so disgust sensitive that they become
unable to tolerate their own body and they see it as a source of corruption
and imperfection which of course is exactly right it is and it's very
difficult thing to maintain order around so anyways so what happens out here in
this terrible domain where scar rules is that things turn into a totalitarian
state you know and he's presented here as as a Nazi like leader and see there's
another thing that's really interesting this even deeper than this from a
mythological perspective I don't know if I can even go into it well not really I
guess what I'll have to do is satisfy myself with this observation there's
always been some antagonism for example between the Catholic Church and
rationalism and everyone knows that it's a very long-standing antagonism that
sort of runs its way through at least the last thousand years or so of Western
civilization and the people who regarded kaathal catholics as antithetical to
science take the Catholics to task for that and
describing it as prejudicial and super and superstitious and fair enough
but there's something else going on there that's more important and that's
the observation and this is at a deep level again the observation that
rationality has one big problem so it's it can easily become arrogant and
believe in its own theories so if you're smart and there's gonna be some of you
people who are like that to some of you your primary the primary trait that
distinguishes you from other people over the course of your whole life was that
you are more intelligent than most and you may have staked your identity on
that and an over value and rationality and the problem with
that is that you you make a theory of the world and then you tend to assume
that it's 100% correct that's the tendency to fall in love with your own
theories and that's what a totalitarian 
wildebeest and so that's what happens here the Whale debate start to march into 
element and because it's not matched 
well to you so but then there's also this other issue which is well maybe
you're not being successful by the terms that are by the values that are
instantiated in the current system and you might say well that's because the
system is set up in an unfair manner and fair enough but it's also possibly
because you're just not very good at acting out those values right so part of
the reason you get alienated from your culture is because the culture is
corrupt but another part of the reason is you're just not doing as well as you
could be you're not playing by the rules properly and so you get alienated and
you're unsuccessful because of your own inadequacies and so the movie plays both
of those it's obviously Simba is set up but there is an intimation that he's not
entirely blameless as well anyways he's very broken up about this and no wonder
it's also partly a story of the emergence of adolescence 
facilitating your drinking so you have 
 
and grinds to a halt and everything
becomes unproductive no it's it's not easy to figure out what makes a society
productive because you might say well it's Natural Resources or something like
that first of all natural resources are very often a curse to a country because
they produce corruption they call that the Dutch disease there's a reason for
that you can look it up but natural resources
in and of themselves are by no means sufficient to guarantee the well-being
of a country Japan has virtually no natural resources at all and it's really
rich and one of the prime natural resources actually seems maybe there's
two one is honesty another is trust and if you can set up a society where people
are roughly honest which means they do what they say they're going to do and
where the default bargaining position on both sides is trust then the probability
that that culture will become wealthy is very very high so and a functional legal
system is also a natural resource of tremendous tremendous value you know
it's partly why people in China for example wealthy people in China are
dumping their money into the real estate market in North America like mad because
one of the things you do know if you buy real estate in North America is you
actually own it it's still gonna be yours 20 years in the future 30 years in
the future there's no doubt about that and so that fact of ownership is
embedded in the functioning legal system and that's what gives those sorts of
properties crazy value you know much to the much to the problematic situation
for all of you people who are at some point most of you are gonna try to buy
property in Toronto and that's really going to be entertaining so now look the
the other thing about scars he's got the little bird locked up right that's the
vision of the king well he doesn't want to know anything he already knows
everything so why does he need this stupid bird flying around telling him
what's going on the last thing he wants to know is
what's going on yeah Stalin I mean God he gave that guy bad news or good
news he was going to have you killed it kept the bad news to a minimum and
that's a real problem right because if you torture people who bring you bad
news then you're never going to learn anything well you don't have to if you
already know everything anyways and so that's the situation here well his
little minions the hyenas are getting pretty unhappy because they haven't had
anything to eat and the reason for that is they've just stripped the landscape
bare right I mean and I read at the demise of the Soviet Union that
something like 10 to 15 percent of the entire land mass of the Soviet Union had
been rendered permanently uninhabitable by industrial pollution so you know that
I don't remember if that included Chernobyl you know where that terrible
nuclear accident took place but but there were massive domains of
devastation and in those countries that you know will take hundreds of years to
fix so anyways when scar rules everyone starves that's a good way of thinking
about it or everyone dies but that's okay because that's really what he's
after anyway so that works out quite nicely now back out here in paradise I
mean look at him how pathetic can you get look at the expression on that
creatures face you know he's he selfs he's sated like someone who's just eaten
a gallon of ice cream and he's got this pathetic self-satisfied naive clueless
unconscious grin on his face which the animators did a very nice job of
capturing like that's a complicated expression and you just want to slap him
and that's exactly what should happen and that's exactly what does happen so
anyways he's out there be an unconscious dingbat well his society is degenerating
and that's bloody well worth thinking about because that's an archetypal trope
right it's like things are sinking around you the question is what are you
doing about it you know are you just staying in kind of a blithe
unconsciousness because you can get your next meal are you gonna wake up and do
something about it well that's the call of the self so now we go back to two
Rafiki here and he knows what's going on in the kingdom he's a symbol of the self
and he also has some inkling that Simba is still alive
so so the son of the king is still alive despite the fact that the land has
become ruled by a tyrant and the son is absent he's still around somehow and so
in a union from the Union perspective there isn't much distinction between the
self and the and the and the child the self is the sum total of all possibility
and the child is possibility itself and so so let's say you've become an
adolescent you're all cynical right and everything's falling apart around you
which is the typical state of human beings right because adolescents are
cynical generally speaking and everything's falling around falling
apart around them generally speaking and so what do you have to do in order to to
do something about that well one is you have to be drawn by the call of wisdom
and the other part is that you have to rediscover that part of yourself that's
a childlike part that's associated with the son and associated with that early
you know the early exposure of Simba to the son you have to find that again and
then trust that some childlike exploration and a bit of manifestation
of faith might get you to the next place and so that's what's happening here with
a little you know the baboon and the tree and the and the drawing so anyways
he knows that Simba is alive now and so he goes off to find him and
meanwhile Simba and his dopey companions are out hunting for bugs
you know because he's a lion you know he should meet bugs for crying out loud but
they're easy and so you see this scene where Pumbaa goes after this bug and
then another lion shows up and chases him so she's gonna kill him and eat him
and ha see that's an interesting thing because one of the things that happens I
suppose you could think about this one of the things that happens in late
adolescence is that the formation of 
so
good unconscious 
useless and so now he's lounging about
you know like some basement with cheeto dust all over his chest and
and trying to justify his absolutely useless life and you know saying that he
doesn't have any responsibility to the devastated Kingdom and he's out there
where Hakuna Matata you know I can just do whatever I want and and follow my
impulsive pleasures and she thinks he's pretty pathetic and the reason for that
is because he is actually pretty pathetic and she she tells him that you
know she's extraordinarily disappointed he gets all pouty about it I mean even
here you see when he when he's got kind of an aggressive look on his face
there's still nothing about it that's commanding it's petulant right it's like
well now I'm irritated but he's got no force and and still completely appalling
in this in this particular situation so she judges him very harshly and leaves
and that makes him think yeah he make gets all self-conscious because this
female that he admires wants to have nothing to do with him
and so he's first of all then he thinks well maybe I'll just hate all women
which is you know pretty pathetic conclusion and but a very common one and
the next is well maybe there's actually something wrong with him right which is
a very painful bit of self-reflection so he he had he notes that there's
something wrong with him and then he calls out to his father and says look
you said you were always going to be here for me and you're not and so what's
happening is that he's become aware of the insufficiency of his current
adolescent value structure and he wants something beyond it which would be
associated with identification with the father but he can't he can't find the
father the father's dead it's like when Pinocchio goes down to the bottom of the
ocean to bring Geppetto up from the depths right that's the situation that
that Simba finds himself in right now the father's gone and has to be brought
up from the depths so this is where the movie takes the the archetypal pathway
of an initiation ceremony so he says he wants to change now one of the things 
become interested in something so if you ask yourself what the next developmental
stages and you really want to know that all of a sudden you're going to become
interested in things that might move you to the next stage and that'll happen
more or less unconsciously so anyways Rafiki entices him and then runs away
and Simba follows him and well that's where he reveals himself as a sage and
then he tells Simba to follow him and he goes underground and this is the
initiation scene right which we talked about at the beginning of the class this
is the descent into the underworld and 
anyways completely
mature right that the facial the 
pathetic facial expression disappears
entirely knee straightens himself up because now he's full of serotonin after
having defeated good old scar and all the lionesses are roaring and he climbs
up Pride Rock and they roar at him which is good they're tough and he's tough and
they showing their teeth it's it's not it's not a society of naive and harmless
creatures it's it's something that's got some bite and the rains come and then
the next thing you see is the restoration of the kingdom and so
basically that what that means is that if the individual is willing to confront
their own shadow and then to take on the malevolent forces that continually
undermine society then harmony can be restored and everyone can do well and so
then we have a return to the beginning right and so Simba and nella are now a
couple along with Pumbaa and Timon and they have a baby and Rafiki shows up and
does the same thing you know he's gonna present the baby to the Sun and have all
the animals bow again and and that's the end of the movie so that's all packed that's all packed into an archetypal
tale and and so one of the things that young would point out is that you all
understood this right while you were watching it because otherwise at some
level all these things made sense they all cohered and the narrative appeared
to be an appropriate narrative even when you're a little kid it because it
strikes a chord inside you and well that chord the thing that it strikes inside
you that's the archetype because if there wasn't something inside of you so
to speak that this could communicate with and it would fall on deaf ears and
it speaks to the part of you that's most particularly human and it's a story of
the development of the sovereign individual that's that's the right way
to think about it's a hero archetype that's another way of thinking about it
and people are going to get that story one way or another and now and then a
piece of public art comes along like this that does a good job of
encapsulating and it captures everyone's imagination and so that's why you've all
seen it and why I presume you all enjoyed it when you were kids and maybe
still enjoy it now so well that was actually faster than I thought it would
be today so this is what I'm gonna do we've got 20 minutes so why don't you
think for a minute or two and I'll take some questions which I don't often do
but and they can be any questions about anything we've covered in class so take
a minute and yes - movie
you feel like you know the character but it's not exactly that character like
become so - you know can like it feels like you know for a wise
old man archetype yeah yeah well there's not
much difference between Gandalf and who's the wizard in Harry Potter
Dumbledore they could be the same guy it's right right and so well that that
is precisely the indication of the existence of an archetype it's like an a
movie one time a student asked me well if if there are these archetypes why
don't we just tell the archetype over and over why do we need fiction for
example which is like a bridge if there's individuals here and the
archetype is up here you know at a high level of abstraction fiction sort of
fills the gap between them and so what you want is a story that's archetypal so
that you understand its basic structure but you want enough variation and
specificity so that it's new and interesting and also applicable to you
so you have to humanize the archetype to some degree otherwise it's so abstract
you can't you can't relate to it and and good stories really do that they bridge
the gap and some of them are more personal and less archetypal but if
they're completely non archetypal there's nothing about them that captures
you it doesn't have any force and then if it's two archetypal well it gets to
be too abstract and you can't relate to it so good fiction writers and and good
purveyors of dramatic entertainment we think about it as entertainment are
really good at occupying that middle position so yeah and they reveal the
archetype through the individual that's one way of thinking about it and and
that keeps it fresh and you know one of the things that you pointed out to was
that you're you're going to be manifesting archetypal patterns of
behavior in your life whether you know it or not
even when you do something like fall in love because that's going to be a very
particular experience for you but it's also a very common experience at the
same time right and and romance is older than people that's one way of looking
about looking at it I mean because sex is older than human beings and so you're
in the grip of something that's really ancient but at the same time it's really
personal and so a good novelist or a writer of fiction is able to capture
both the personal element of that to show show the transpersonal within the
personal and so and in some sense your destiny property
study from a union perspective is to consciously express an archetype and so
be the archetype there's a bunch of them but one of them would be the archetype
of the hero and you're supposed to manifest that in the conditions of your
own life so that makes the archetype real in the conditions of your own life
and Jung would also say that when you're doing that your experience will manifest
itself as meaningful and so it's because in some sense you're acting in
accordance with your deepest instincts technically speaking right you're you're
acting out what it means to be human in the world and you're gonna find that
meaningful so yes like like I just like because it's mine process from life
like happy but is like appreciating to help so like you know like love and subsidies okay so the question is about the
relationship between the shadow and the okay so the first thing you have to
understand with regards to trying to come to terms with the conception of the
shadow is to understand the idea of persona and persona is the you that you
present when you want people to accept and like you often like let's say that
you go to a party and you're trying to 
imagine that an idea has been sold around for so long and that people have
acted out for so long that it's actually become part of the landscape that does
the selection so think about it this way 

because there is evidence now that you can inherit acquired characteristics and
that was nobody thought that was possible 20 years ago so things are have
taken a very weird twist in the Darwinian world but for the sake of
argument we could say that the mutation process is random but the selection
process isn't random it's not even close to random ever since creatures have been
able to evaluate one another the selection process hasn't been random and like if you divide people by
their political affiliation it looks like liberal men are the most unhappy
they're higher in neuroticism I think the openness probably
contributes to it as well but we don't and also possibly the low
conscientiousness when my graduate students come in or one of the many ways
we're gonna talk about this in some detail because she's going to tell you
because we've also looked at the personality predictors of political
correctness which is extraordinarily interesting as well because it doesn't
really seem to fall exactly on the
