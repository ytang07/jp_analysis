all right so I suggested to you last class that human beings world as a place
of action through the lens of their social cognitive biological sub
structure and I made that argument on the basis of the supposition that our
primary environment was actually other people and I mentioned to you I believe
that those other people are arranged in hierarchies of influence and authority
or power or dominance which is often how its construed and that the dominance
hierarchy as a structure is at least 300 million years old
which makes it older than trees and it's for that reason that you share the same
neural biology to govern your observations of your position in the
hierarchy as lobsters do which is a remarkable fact you know it's a
remarkable that the lobster uses serotonin as the mechanism to adjudicate
its status position and that modifying the serotonin function in the lobster
can produce changes in its behavior can can / help the logs to overcome defeat
for example which is very much equivalent to what happens to a human
being when they take antidepressants you know it's it's it's a good example of
the conservation of biological structure by evolution and another a good
illustration of the continuity of life on Earth it's really amazing but the
other thing it is a testament to is the ancient nature of the social structure
now we tend to think of the social structure as something other than nature
right because society is I suppose mythologically opposed it's opposed in a
narrative way cultures opposed to nature it's the town in the forest but the town
has been around a long time so to speak and the structure of the town is also
part of nature in that the dominance hierarchy is part of
and because it's so ancient you have to consider it as part of the mechanism
that has played the role of selection in the process of natural selection and so
roughly seem what seems to happen is that there is a plethora of dominance
hierarchies especially in complex human communities and many of them are
masculine in structure in that their dominance are keys that primarily men
compete in or that has been the historical norm and that some men rise
to the top based on whatever the dominance hierarchy is based on and they
make their preferential mates and it's a good strategy for women to engage in
because why and many sorts of female animals do precisely this is they let
the male's battle it out and then pick from the top and or often the dominant
males there's no choice on the part of the females it's the dominant males just
chasing away the subordinate males but with humans it's usually the case that
the females have the opportunity to do at least some choosing and so we have if
you think about that what that implies is that we have evolved to climb up
dominance hierarchies and then I would say it's not exactly that even because
there are many different dominance hierarchies and so the skills that you
might use to climb up one might not be necessarily the same skills that you
would use to climb up another and so then I would say what we have all
evolved for instead and I'm still speaking mostly on the masculine edge of
things historically speaking is the ability to climb up the set of all
possible dominance hierarchies right and that's that's a whole different idea
it's like the averaged hierarchy across vast spans of time and I think it's for
that reason that we among others that we evolve general intelligence because
general intelligence is a general problem-solving mechanism and it seems
to be situation in depend so to speak and of course there's been
an arms race for the development of intelligence between men and women
because each gender has to keep up with the other and women have their own
dominance hierarchies there's certainly no doubt about that
and of course now men and women more increasingly compete within the same
hierarchies and we don't exactly know how to sort that out yet because it's an
extraordinarily new phenomena but in any case because of the the permanence of
the dominance hierarchy it has come to be represented in fundamental narratives
because human beings and this is something that we share everywhere it's
the thing the Wall Street bankers shares with with the kalahari Kung Bushmen who
are among the genetically speaking they seem to be very close to what the
original most original human beings were like in Africa before the Diaspora about
fifty thousand years ago but you know both of those people
despite their vast differences live in communities that have a hierarchical
structure that are composed of individuals that are embedded in a
natural world you know the world outside of the dominant Sarki and so that's the
standard human environment I would say and so stories that rely on the
representations of those environments and their interactions are what you
might describe as universal stories and that's why people can understand them
and I would say further and this is drawing substantially on say derivation
of the work of Carl Jung because I think he delved into this more deeply than
anyone else so a lot of this stuff is quite Union in its in its origins we the
commonality between human beings so you know you have to have commonalities in
order to communicate right axiomatic commonalities because otherwise you have
to explain everything and so there's many things that human beings don't have
to explain to one another we don't have to explain anger we do
have to explain jealousy we don't have to explain fear we don't have to explain
pain we don't have to explain joy we don't have to explain love etc those are
built into us and so there are predicates of being human and you could
say that those human predicates and the standard human environment produce
standard narratives and then you could say even further and this is more of a
leap I would say is that those who act out the role of the victor in those
standard narratives are precisely the people who attain victory in life and I
would say biologically defined in that 
sort of 
loveless marriage and eliminated for the purpose of relating something about the structure of the
world 
way to hell and what he meant by that
was it's through an analysis of your own shadow that you can come to understand
why other people are capable and you as well of the sorts of terrible atrocities
that characterize let's say the 20th century and without that understanding
there's no possibility of bringing it under control when you study Nazi
Germany for example or you study the Soviet Union particularly under Stalin
and you're asking yourself well what are these perpetrators like forget about the
victims let's talk about the perpetrators the answer is they're just
like you and if you don't know that that just means that you don't know anything
about people including yourself and then it also means that you have to discover
why they're just like you and believe me that's no picnic so that's enough to
traumatize people and that's partly why they don't do it and it's also partly
why the path to enlightenment and wisdom is seldom trod upon because if it was
all a matter of following your bliss and doing what made you happy then everyone
in the world would be a paragon of wisdom but it's not that at all it's the
it's a matter of facing the thing you least want to face and everyone has that
old there's this old story in King Arthur where
the night's go off to look for the Holy Grail which is either the cup that
Christ drank out of it the Last Supper or the cup into which the blood that
gushed from his side was poured when he was crucified the stories vary but it's
it's basically a holy object like the Phoenix in some sense that's
representation a representation of transformation so it's a it's an ideal
and so King Arthur's knights who sit at a round table because they're all
roughly equal go off to find the most valuable thing and they and where do you
look for the most valuable thing when you don't know where it is well each of
the knights looks at the forest surrounding the castle and enters the
forest at the point that looks darkest to him and that's a good thing to
understand because the gateway to wisdom and the gateway to the development of
personality which is exactly the same thing is precisely through the porthole
portal that you do not want to climb through and the reason for that's
actually quite technical this is a union presupposition - is that well there's a
bunch of things about you that are underdeveloped and a lot of those things
are because there's things you've avoided looking at because you don't
want to look at them and there's parts of you you've avoided developing because
it's hard for you to develop those parts and so it's by virtual necessity that
what you need is where you don't want to look because that's where you've kept it
and so and that's why there's you know an idiosyncratic element of it for
everyone your particular place of enlightenment and terror is not going to
be the same as yours except that they're both places of enlightenment and terror
so they're equivalent at one level of analysis and and different than another
so anyways back to the fiction and and and and what it does if it distills
truth and it produces characters that are composites and the more they become
composites the more they approximate a mythological character and so they
become more and more universally true and more and more approximating
religious deities but the problem with that is they become more and more
distant from individual experience and so with
literature there's this very tight line where you need to make the character
more than merely human but not so much of a God that you know one of the things
that happened to Superman in the 1980s Superman started out he's got a heavenly
set a parents by the way in an earthly set of parents and he's an orphan like
Harry Potter very common theme is that when Superman first emerged he could
only jump out of her buildings you know and maybe he could stop a locomotive but
by the time the 1980s rolled around like he could juggle planets and you know
swallow hydrogen bombs and you know he could do anything well people stopped
buying the Superman comics because how interesting is that it's like something
horrible happens and Superman deals with it and something else horrible happens
and Superman deals with it and it's like that's dull he turned into such an
archetype he was basically the omniscient omnipresent omnipotent God
and that's no fun it's like God wins and then God wins again and then again God
wins and you know so then they had to weaken him in different ways with
kryptonite you know so green kryptonite kind of made him sick and red kryptonite
I think kind of mutated him if I remember correctly and anyways they had
to introduce flaws into his characters so that there could be some damn plot
and that's something to think about you know there's a deep existential lesson
in that in that your being is limited and flawed and fragile you're like the
genie which is genius in the little tiny in the little tiny lamp
you know this immense potential but constrained in this tiny little living
space as Robin Williams said when he played the genie in Aladdin but the fact
that you have limitations means that the plot of your life is the overcoming of
those limitations and that if you didn't have limitations well there wouldn't be
a plot and maybe there would be no life and so that's part of the reason why
perhaps you have to accept the fact that you're flawed and insufficient and and
live with it and consider it a precondition for being it's at least a
reasonable it's a reasonable idea so anyways one of
the main characters is the country the known the explored territory we went
over that a bit and it always has two elements I mean your country is your
greatest friend and your worst enemy you know because it squashes you into
conformity and demands that you act in a certain manner and reduces your
individuality to that element that's tolerated by everyone else and it it
constrains your potential in a single direction and so it's really tyrannical
but at the same time it provides you 
with a place to be and all of the
benefits that have accrued as a result of the actions of your ancestors and all
the other people that you're associated with so there's the good tyrant or the
bad tyrant and the good King and those are archetypal figures and that's
because they're always true and they're always true simultaneously you know
which is partly why I object to the notion of the patriarchy because it's a
myth the law the it's the what do you call that it's the apprehension of a
mythological trope which is that of the evil tyrant without any appreciation for
the fact that the archetype actually has two parts and the other part is the wise
king and you know you can tell an evil tyrant story about culture no problem
but it's one-sided and that's very dangerous because you don't want to
forget all the good things that you have while you're criticizing all the ways
that things are in error that's a lack of gratitude and it's a lack of wisdom
and it's it's founded in resentment and it's it's very dangerous both personally
and socially I told you that Captain Hook is a tyrant because he's got this
crocodile chasing him in the crocodile has a clock in its stomach and that's
death it's like obviously right tick tick tick tick and it's a crocodile and
it's under the water and it's already got a taste of him so he's being chased
around by death and that makes him terrified and resentful and and cruel
and bitter so he's a tyrant and he wants to wreak
havoc everywhere and then Peter Pan of course looks at Captain Hook and thinks
why the hell should I grow up and to be a tyrant and sacrifice all the potential
of childhood and the answer to that is the potential sacrifices itself if you
don't utilize it as you mature and you just end up a 40 year old lost boy which
is a horrifying thing to behold it's almost as if you're the corpse of a
child the living corpse of a child because who the hell wants a
six-year-old 40 year old you're a little on the stale side by that point and not
the world's happiest individual so you know your potential is going to
disappear because you aged anyways and so you might as well shape that
potential in a particular direction and at least become something no matter how
limited rather than nothing so you know Peter Pan that's a great story it's a
great mythological story so well so let's talk about tyrants well not only
are they mythological figures but they exist and they tend to be deified I mean
Stalin was for all intents and purposes God the Father in Soviet Russia although
he was pretty much only the worst elements of Old Testament God who was
you know constantly smiting people and and wiping out populations and doing all
sorts of things that seem to be quite nasty but nonetheless you know people
worshipped him in many ways and and he's a representation of just exactly what
goes wrong when things really go wrong when people stop paying attention and
when they all lie because one of the things that characterized the communist
state was that no one ever got to say anything they actually believed ever and
that was partly because one out of three people was an informer which meant if
you had a family of six people two of them were informing on the government
about you and that included your own children and you and if you were an
informer you were often amply rewarded by the state so that if you lived in an
overcrowded apartment building with three families in the same
flat and you informed on you know the woman down the hall that you didn't like
she got shift shipped off to the old concentration camp and you got her
apartment and so that was a lovely society and it only killed about thirty
million people between 1919 and nineteen fifty-nine so that's what happens when
the archetypal structure gets tilted badly when people forget that they have
a responsibility to fulfill as citizens as awake citizens who are capable of
stating the truth and the archetype shift so there's nothing left of the
Great Father except the tyrant and let's not have that happen I mean the one on
the right is really interesting because consciously or unconsciously you know
there's Stalin surrounded by what is for all intents and purposes fire you know
he looks like he looks like Maleficent in Sleeping Beauty when she shows up at
Aurora's christening you know she puts her arms up in the air and green fire
surrounds her it's like it's like he's surrounded by fire and there's Lenin
above him who's like king of the fiery realm and that's for sure
so I mean all the terrors that happened in the Soviet Union didn't start under
stell and they started under Lenin and Lenin was or Stalin was definitely
Lenin's legitimate son let's put it that way so you know this is another example
of the tyrannical element of the Great Father and the sorts of things that can
happen I mean I kind of got a an evil kick out of this bad that was quite old
you know it's kitschy in some sense and and you
know it shows I don't think that's something you'd ever see at a magazine
today 10 unusual stamps showing evil dictator
you know well fair enough I mean that's what he was and that's the consequence
and that's just a tiny bit of the consequence because the Nazis wiped out
a very large number of people often using compassion as a as a as a
as a justification so when they went after the mentally ill and the
terminally ill and those who whose intelligence was compromised for
biological reasons and and those who were too old
they basically justified it by saying that the enforced euthanasia was
merciful and that you were actually being a good person by complying with
the requirements and so something to think about
more mythological representations I like these quite a bit so there's their
Hitler as you know Knight of the faith essentially with I suppose that's a
recreation of the Christian holy spirit dove you know except it's an eagle which
is a bird of prey and and a prayer and uh what do you call those things a
scavenger right so that's kind of 
interesting but that's Hitler as night
of the of the blood roughly speaking and there this is an allied war poster 
essentially that assimilates the Nazis to poisonous snakes and you know we
don't like poisonous snakes very much and and it's probably because they've
been preying on us for approximately twenty million years because snakes and
primates humans in particular co-evolved and so the snake is a representation of
that which lies outside the comfortable domain and that can be you know a snake
obviously or it can be an abstract snake and the abstract snake is your enemy or
an even more abstract snake is the evil in your own heart and this is going to
be a bit of a leap for you but there's this ancient idea that developed in what
in the West over thousands of years far predating Christianity 
snake would be also a predator but maybe
that's the predator that represents the the destructive spirit of the other
tribe because chimpanzees for example are quite tribal and they definitely go
to war with one another and so you think you abstract out the idea of the
predator to represent malevolence as such and then you take that one step 
further and you realize that the worst of all evil predators is the human
capacity for evil and then at that point you know you're starting to I would say
psychologize or spiritual eyes the idea of danger and making it make it into
something that's conceptual and something that's psychological and
something that you can you can face sort of on mas I mean one of the things
people had to figure out was how do you deal with danger and so you feel figure
out how you deal with a specific danger but then because human beings are death
so damn smart they thought well what if we considered the class of all dangerous
things and then what have we considered a a mode of being that was the best mode
of being in the face of the class of all dangerous things well that's a lot
better you get you know you could solve all the dangerous problems all at once
instead of having to conjure up a different solution for every dangerous
thing and that's basically as far as I can tell where the hero's story came
from and the hero's story is basically you know there's a community it's
threatened by the emergence of some old evil
often represented by a dragon that's sort of typical say of the Lord of the
Rings stories there's a hero often a humble guy but not always sometimes a
knight decides he'll go out there you know and chase down the snake maybe even
or the serpent or the dragon maybe even in its lair and he'll have a bunch of
adventures on the way that transform him from you know useless naive Hobbit into
you know sword wielding hero and he confronts the dragon and gets the gold
and frees the people that it had enslaved and then comes back transformed
to share what he's learned with the community it's like well that's the
human story fundamentally and that's that's our basic instinctive pattern and
it's represented in narratives constantly and that's partly what this
see this has meaning you know what this means
why why do you know well you know because it draws on symbolic
representations that you already understand you understand that a mess of
tooth snakes is not a good thing and that may be the sensible thing to do is
stomp them and it's not like you need an instruction manual to figure out what
the poster means and so you know that's two different representations of Hitler
that's sort of the pro-hitler representation and I would say that's
the anti-hitler representation and you know that's the real Hitler who at this
point does not look like a very happy clam so so that's the known that's
culture that's order and what's eternally juxtaposed to culture and the
known and the explored and order is the unknown and the unknown is a strange
place the unknown is actually it's a physical place like the unknown is the
place that when you're camping and you're around a fire the unknown is
everything outside the circle of the light and you remember in the Lion King
you may not remember when when when Mufasa that's the king right goes and
takes Simba up to show him his territory he says he is the king of everything
that the light touches and that's a very old idea and you guys
had no problem with you know that was fine that made sense and that I would be
on the light was the darkness and that was the elephant graveyard that was
death that was the place of death and danger that's where the hyenas hung out
and you weren't supposed to go there and so of course Simba because he's a rule
breaking hero just like Harry Potter immediately goes there and so you know
that's like the forbidden fruit it's the same sort of idea if you want someone to
do something the best thing to do is tell them that they shouldn't and not
explain why you know so for example if I said to you at the beginning of this
class look I've got one rule here don't sit in that chair no matter what you'd
be thinking the whole year especially if I reminded you well just what's up with
that chair like let's chair as magical all of a sudden you some of you might
even well you probably wouldn't because this is a ridiculous example but maybe
you know you come to class early and sit in that chair just to see what would
happen you know and people are very curious and that's exactly what we're
like and that's a very old story too right it's like opening Pandora's box
don't open that box you'll be sorry it's like oh huh you know all the horrors of
the world fly out and believe me you will open Pandora's box many times in
your life because you know with your family or maybe your mate or maybe your
children you'll have this idea that they have a box with things in it that you
want to know about and you'll say well I'm kind of curious about this
particular event so why don't you tell me about it and they say well no we
probably really shouldn't open that box and you keep bugging them and then they
open it and then all sorts of things fly out that you didn't expect and then
maybe you think hey it would have been better if I would have just left that
damn box closed but and you can do the same thing to yourself believe me
and so the Pandora's box idea the forbidden fruit idea that's that's a
major-league idea and part of the reason in the judeo-christian tradition why
people are saddled with the notion of original sin is because hyper cortically
developed chimpanzees without much sense can
keep their hands off things and so they keep exploring even when they know
better and every time they do that they learn something that is that destroys
the paradise that they currently inhabit right because there's plenty Unni and I
never learned anything in your life that's of importance without it having a
pretty damn destabilizing effect on you 
at the moment of realisation right you
learn something happy it's like whatever you know that all that means is that I
was doing things right like it's nice and everything but it's not informative
you do something and all hell breaks loose that'll make you think that's for
sure you might never stop thinking for the rest of your life so anyways the
unknown the unknown is that which surrounds the known it's an unexplored
territory it's usually represented as female I think for a variety of reasons
and not not as female exactly it's not the right way to think about it as
feminine and that's not the same thing because feminine is a symbolic category
whereas female is like an actual female and so you don't want to confuse the
metaphor with with the with the actuality because we have these social
cognitive categories built-in you know you might say masculine feminine and
offspring something like that we had to use what we could to represent what we
were attempting to figure out and we kind of mapped them onto the external
realities of being the best we could using what we could and so you know
nature is benevolent and it's fruitful you know all things come from nature and
all things come from the unknown right because the known is already there it's
the unknown that manifests the new right and so that's part of the reason for the
characterization of the unknown as feminine and then there's also the case
that women play a massive role in sexual selection among human beings so that mmm
from an evolutionary perspective you're twice as likely to be a failure if
you're a man then you or if you're a woman in that you have
twice as many female ancestors as male ancestors and you think well that's
impossible but it's not all you have to do is imagine that every woman has one
child half the men have two and the other half have zero and so end of
problem and that's basically how it works out so women are more choosy
mater's than men by a substantial margin there was a funny study done by the guy
who established it's one of the big dating sites and he looked at how women
rated men and they rated the 50th percentile man at the 15th percentile so
85% of men were below average according to women's ratings now men had their
same arbitrary choices because of course they preferred younger women to older
women and and they were more swayed I would say by by attractiveness but that
didn't have set nearly as big an effect on their actually actually writing of
women so anyway so you know from from a Darwinian perspective nature is that
which selects so that's all it is and so sexual selection plays a massive role in
human evolution you know the fact that we have these massive brains is very
likely a consequence of a positive feedback loop and sexual selection
you know because otherwise that's the only time you can get really rapid
changes in evolutionary space where you know you get a process going that
reinforces itself so there's a little preference for intelligence and then
that produces more intelligent men and women and then there's a little more
preference for intelligence and you know maybe then that turns into the ability
to speak and or to master fire and then there's way more selection for
intelligence and the brain just goes like this you know and women have paid a
pretty big price for that because your hips are basically so wide that you can
barely run and if they were any wider than you couldn't and of course the
pelvic passageway through which the baby travels is too small so it's
really painful and dangerous and the baby's head has to compress quite a lot
I mean they come out cone-shaped often and then they're born really young so
you have to take care of them forever like what the hell you know a deer is
born a fawn is born and it's like two seconds later it's standing and then
it's running from a lion it's like you know it's like 15 minutes later and a
baby it's like you just lies there and you know utters plaintive noises that's
all it can do and that does that for like ten months before it could skitter
away from a sloth if it was predatory you know so you really got to take care
of those creatures and so that's a big price to pay that's a big price to pay
for our cortical evolution so anyways here is some of the symbolic represents
representatives of the unknown the unconscious Dionysian force of the it'd
that sort of Freud's representation of the unknown the terrors of the darkness
that's the unknown the monsters that lurk they're the source and the resting
place of all things the great mother the Queen the matrix which means matter
which means mother the matriarch matter mother the
container the cornucopia the object to be fertilized the source of all things
the fecund the pregnant the strange the emotional
the foreigner the place of return and rest the deep the valley the cleft the
cave hell death and the grave because it's beyond the moon ruler of the night
and mysterious dark and matter and the earth then you know all this because
when you watch a movie that's rife with symbolic representations it draws on
those underlying metaphors and they're natural I mean where does a witch live
well in a swamp for God's sake she doesn't live in the penthouse of a New
York Tower she lives in a swamp and it's dark there and if the moon's up that's a
better and maybe it could be a crescent moon or maybe it could be a full moon
but you know witches live in the right place if you're going to understand it
and you all you understand all of that and it's part of the structure of your
imagination you could say and so it's part of the unspoken
fantastical imagination that unites all of us and it makes us specifically human
there's a good representation of the underworld and the place of
transformation so that's Hell in Isis in Egypt was queen of the underworld and
the underworld generally has a queen and she usually shows up when order falls
apart and so you go to the underworld when your life falls apart that's what
it means and so when you see these 
think that 
and so believe me lots of people
died trying to figure that out so here's another way of looking at it 
so I said you know order and chaos known unknown explored territory unexplored 
that
 they couldn't update the model they just didn't have the neurology for it anymore 
right because a little novelty heightens
your anxiety that wakes you up a bit that's the adventure part of it but it
also focuses the part of your brain that does exploratory activity and that's
actually associated with pleasure that's the dopamine circuit and so if
you're optimally balanced and you know that you know you're there when you're
listening to an interesting conversation or you're engaged in one it's a real
conversation you know you're saying some things you know and the other person is
saying some things they know but the both of what you know is
changing it's like wow that's so interesting you'll have a conversation
like that forever or maybe you're reading a book like that or you're
listening to a piece of music that models that because what music does is
provide you with predictable forms multi-level predictable forms that
transform just the right amount and so music is a
very representational art form it says this is what the universe is like you
know there's a dancing element to it repetitive and then cute little
variations that sort of surprise and delight you and and you think wow that's
so cool and it doesn't matter how nihilistic you are you know music still
infuses you with a sense of meaning and that's because it models meaning that's
what it does that's why we love it and you know you can dance to it and that
sort of symbolizes you putting yourself in harmony with these multiple layers of 
reality and positioning yourself properly and you like that too you know
you'll pay for it oh boy I get to go dancing you know oh boy I get to listen
to music it's like what the hell are you doing listening to music what good is
that well you think that's a stupid question I don't care about your dopey
criticism I'm going to listen to some music right it did there's no rational
there's no rational argument against music it's like you just don't even
think about it you just walk away from someone who's stupid enough to ask that
question it's like some things are obvious
well why okay so that's pretty fun so what mediates between these two domains
well that's what consciousness does far as I can tell and that's sort of the
individual and that's the hero that's another way of thinking about it it's
the logos that's another way of thinking about it it's the word that generates
order out of chaos at the beginning of time it's the consciousness that
interacting with the matter of the world produces being that's basically it
that's basically you for all intents and purposes
how do you do that well the unconscious does it to some degree you know because
it's with our fantasy that we first meet the unknown right well look say you're
going out with a new person it's like what do you do you project a fantasy on
them and then you fall in love with the fantasy and aren't you stupid because
you're gonna find out that the match between your damn fantasy and the actual
person is tenuous at best and so young would call that a projection of either
the anima or the animus you know the anima is what a man projects onto a
woman he finds desirable it's like oh she's the perfect woman
it's like well how do you know that you've like seen her for four seconds
you know but it grips you and the same thing happens in the opposite direction
and it's an action of instinct you know it's like you fall in love with the
image and but interestingly enough what you do in a relationship that works is
that you actually I think that what you see
it's a rough approximation when you project the ideal and fall in love with
it you see what could be it could be that but it's going to take you a hell
of a lot of work because like you got no shortage of flaws and the other person
has no shortage of flaws and so you're bringing your flaws together and that's
going to produce a lot of friction and you're gonna have to engage in a lot of
dialogue before you approach that level of perfection again but maybe you can do
it then you get to live happily ever after
well would not be nice well so the unconscious meets the unknown and it it
meets it with imagination and fantasy and dream and art that's how you take so
you don't just go from what you don't know to fully articulated knowledge in
one bloody leap you can't do that you have to extend pseudo pods of fantasy
and imagination into the unknown that's kind of what theorizing is like right
even scientifically you know you don't know something scientifically you
generate a theory well it's an imaginative representation that your
unconscious is helping you generate and so you meet the unknown with fantasy
that's what the unconscious is for from the psychoanalytic perspective that's
what rheems do and you can see why you dream
about the future you know it's like well what's the future gonna be like well you
have a little imaginative story going on and it's like you don't really create it
it's sort of you watch it unfold you know maybe you could tweak it here and
there but it sort of comes to you from wherever the hell things like that come
from you know the unconscious that's the psychoanalytic answer it's not really
much of an answer because it's more like a representation of a place that we
don't understand but that's where creativity comes from and I mean some
people are really creative right down to the bloody core so in my clinical
practice I often see people who are high in openness because they're attracted to
me because they watch my lectures and you have to kind of be high in openness
to like my lectures so because well you do because they go everywhere you know
and and they're not necessarily very orderly so so anyways lots of my clients
are really high in openness and they're funny people often especially if they're
smart because sometimes they have the most nihilistic intelligence you can
imagine it's just self-critical and nihilistic and brutally brutal man and
smart and so they just criticize themselves out of existence and so often
I have to just try to get them to quit 
listening to their chattering right
self-critical rationality and go out and create something you know with their
massive creativity and as long as they're doing that they're engaged in
the world and happy as hell but why
you would prefer chaos to order is beyond me and the only possible reason
is that you haven't read enough history 

and I'm not denigrating fantasy by the way and it's projected imaginatively 
that's what you're doing all the time now can I explain that well no I have no
idea how consciousness and the substrate of the world interact
i I can only say that that's how it looks that's how it feels
you know that's how people act and they'll get into trouble if they don't
manifest their potential whatever that is that's all those things you could be
that you're not well where are those it's just potential well that's the
chaos this is a that's the I would say that's the the cosmos that's the cosmos
that you live in all the time it's a little story it's the thing that you
extract out of the chaos it's - consists of your conception of where
you are now and your conception of where you want to be at some point could be
ten minutes could be three years if you can slide it and then you have a little
plan about how you should move your body to do transform one in into the other
that's your action powder and that's a little story and when you ask someone to
say what they were up to you they'll tell you a little story like that you
know I was at some place and I went somewhere else and here's how I did it
then they might tell you more interesting story which is I was
someplace and something happened that I really didn't expect and it knocked me
for a loop you know and that's a good 
divorce story I came home one night and
my wife was gone it's like yeah chaos and probably a bit of willful blindness
preceding it we might suspect anyways down into chaos and then well
maybe you learn something down there and maybe you don't but hopefully you do and
you put yourself together if you're lucky and then pop bang you pop up into
another little structure of order and that's an initiatory process it's like
you're some more stable falls apart or maybe you break it apart on purpose you
do it voluntarily you know people do that all the time you know they do that
for example when they experiment with drugs and they do that when they go on
wild adventures and you know when they break themselves out of their normal
routine and throw themselves somewhere they don't understand and hope that
that's going to produce a transformation of personality that's the basic story
that's the initiatory story now this is William James who was the one of the
establishes of modern psychology and a kind of an odd guy he was an early
experimenter with psychedelics of course they'll never tell you that but he was
and he is his drug of choice was nitrous oxide which is an inhalant gas which
seems to be inert no one really knows why it works but it produces he
practiced that for years and he had these autonomous beings manifest
themselves in his fantasy it had long conversations with them it just you know
while he was working as a doctor and having a sane normal life and well it's
kind of well it's really something whatever the symptoms they're felt is
painful while he thought maybe he was going mad and some people think he did
if not agonizing by the subject with alternating periods of alleviation and
worsening throughout the illness the subject never loses the thread of his
dominating preoccupation it's often compatible with normal professional
activity and family life but even if he keeps to his social activities
he's almost entirely absorbed with himself he suffers from feelings of
utter isolation even when he has a mentor who guides him through the ordeal
like the shaman apprentice with his master the termination is often rapid
and marked by a phase of exhilaration the subject emerges from his ordeal
with a permanent Tran formation in his personality and a
conviction that he has discovered a great truth or a new spiritual world
many of the 19th and 20th century figures regarded universally as great
Nietzsche Darwin Dostoyevsky Tolstoy Freud Jung were all additionally
characterized by lengthy periods of profound psychological unrest and
uncertainty well you don't generate a new theory
without some birth pangs right because your old theory has to bite the dust
first and when your old theory bites the 
dust it's like where are you you don't he stepped out and now he was big it's like that was 

more into Union psychology which is the what we're going after after sleeping 
from dragons we go hunt them down and so 
basically is there's a bounded space a walled garden a walled city you know on
all the original cities were walled because if they weren't barbarians would
swoop in and they'd just steal all your stuff and so you know that was kind of
pointless so you know you wanted to have some major-league walls surrounding your 
unknown 
the threatening future it might be the 
threatening present but you realized as
his as he got older that that the unconscious was also the world and they 

 
hey they're tougher than they thought they were and that's what you're
 
that's what that is so either thing is no joke it's like look the hell out and 
that's this you know and look it up at the top right hand corner there you know
that's from Peter Pan right well you remember Captain Hook we talked about
him already he's a tyrant and he's a tyrant because he's afraid of death and
that's all he sees in life and so it makes him cruel and better and 
whole category at the same time
that's the thing that's how to be in the world is to deal with that category all
at the same time and so how did how did human beings what did they come up with
as a solution and that's so cool too because the solution they come up with
not only was the heroism that allows you to approach what you're terrified by and
what you find offensive and to learn from it but also the idea of sacrifice
and and that was played out by cultures everywhere including human sacrifice and
you think what the hell was up with those crazy bastards so long ago they
were sacrificing two gods all the time what kind of clueless behavior was that
burned something and please God burn something valuable and please God it's
like what was with them what were they thinking well they weren't stupid those
people if they were stupid we wouldn't be here they were not stupid and believe
me they lived under a lot harsher conditions than we do so those were some
tough people man you know back then you'd last about 15 minutes and so you
don't want to be thinking of your ancestors as stupid like there's no real
evidence that we're much different cognitively than we were a hundred and
fifty thousand years ago so anyways sacrifice what does that mean
sacrifice well it's a discovery man it's the discovery of the future it's like
the future is actually the place where there is threat and it's always gonna be
there so what do you do you make sacrifices in the present so that the
future is better right everyone does that that's what you're doing right now
that's what you're doing here that's what your parents are doing when they
pay money to send you to university they think you can bargain with reality it's
amazing you can bargain with reality you can forestall gratification now and 
it'll pay off it at a place in time that doesn't even exist yet it's like who
would have believed that it's like that's a miracle that that occurs and
it's not like people just figured that overnight you know we were chimps for
Christ's sake like how are we gonna come up with an idea like that well it's like
well we thought about it for seven million years and you know we got to the
point where we could kind of act it out but we didn't know what we were doing
but it was a merge it's like a dream it was
so the terror of the future is a dream and the solution to the terror the dream
of the terror of the future is another dream and and it comes out in mythology
and in fantasy and in drama where you act out the sacrifice and then it's 
descended from these same primates all 
right so now the initiation when you go into
psychotherapy or when you make any supreme moral effort which is roughly
the same thing you have to confront that which you do not know now I mentioned
the called prima cosmogonic chaos and the idea that at the end of Jung's life
he sort of thought of the unconscious and the world as the same and you think
what the hell does that mean but here's what it means so let's say you're in a
long-term intimate relationship and you get betrayed okay so what is it that you
see when you see your partner at the moment you know of the betrayal well you
see the pre maganda chaos and here's why well it
rattles your unconscious up because you don't know anything anymore you don't
know what the past was right you don't know what it was and it's supposed to be
real and all of a sudden you don't know what it was and so you come up with wild
ideas about what it might have been and what it represented and then you don't
know what the future is gonna be anymore so then your fantasy fills that space
and you don't know who the hell you're looking at that's for sure and you don't
know much about human beings and you certainly don't know anything about
yourself and so all of a sudden not only is
everything in chaos inside your mind but everything is in chaos
in your world and it actually is and there's no telling the difference
between those two things you know and so then they you're just shattered and so
then you go talk to a therapist for like two years and you think what happened
what was the reality and the reality is because who knows what the reality was
like but as far as you're concerned the reality is I better represent this
properly in my head I better figure out who I was who that person was what we
did together and what it meant because I do not want this to happen again and so
you're healed when you get to the point where you've
grasped the bloody moral of the story what went wrong and how can I not have
that happen again because that's the purpose of learning
right that's the purpose of memory it's to prepare you for the future and so you
have to pull out of that massive chaos a functional representation that increases
your wisdom so that you're not this naive target the next time you enter
into a relationship so at least you can have another relationship without being
so traumatized that you know you you're done and you know it can take people
years to talk that through because this landscape of potential opens up when
when they're betrayed it's like well anything could have been the truth well
you to sort through that you have to wander through all that mess and it's
really painful and and emotional as well you have to sort through all that mess
to come out with the new you right there renewed you and so
well this is a representation of it this is how people act this out by but
whatever method he may have been designated the shaman is recognized as
