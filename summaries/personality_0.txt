regarded as learning how to perceive and 
behave 
relationship to your negative emotion health and well-being 

schedules and at planning the use of their time and so I would like to say
that you should all be smarter but I don't know how you could be smarter we
don't know anything about how to improve intelligence and I suppose we don't
really know anything about how to improve industriousness either but I can
tell you that people who are industrious come up with a strategy for solving the
problem that's ahead of them and then they do whatever they can to stick to 
the strategy and so for example if you sat down today or tomorrow for a couple
of hours three hours and you filled in a google calendar whatever you happen to
use with a strategy for studying and a list of when all your assignments are 
you space it out then you're much more
likely to remember it's also much more likely that you're you're much more
likely to remember if you try to recall the material and so highlighting and
that sort of thing isn't very useful but reading closing the book summarizing
what you've read without opening the damn book that's useful and the reason
for that is that you're practicing remembering and that's what you have to
practice if you're practicing memorization you have to practice
remembering you don't just go over the thing over and over
that'll help you with recognition memory but some but it won't help you with
recall memory so anyways the last trade is openness openness is a creativity
trait it's also associated with intelligence in that intelligent people
and I'm speaking technically of IQ tend to be higher and tend to be more
creative which is hardly surprising creative people are more likely to be
liberal politically by the way they like novelty they like aesthetics they like
fiction they like movies they like art they like poetry there is something
about them that grants them an aesthetic sensitivity and and that's a that's an
inbuilt trait and it's not the case by the way that everyone's creative in fact
far from it we've used the creative achievement questionnaire to to measure
people's creativity I'll talk to you about that later in the class and the
creative achievement questionnaire takes 13 dimensions of creativity so you know
writing dancing acting scientific investigation entrepreneurial activity
architectural activity cooking there's a there's a handful of others singing etc
you know the sorts of things that you would assume that people could be
creative about and then it asks people to rate themselves on a scale from one
to ten on their level of achievement with regards to all those creative
domains with zero being I have no training or proficiency in this area and
70% of people score zero across the entire creative achievement
questionnaire a tiny proportion of people are outliers way out and they're
creative in many dimensions simultaneously and it
exceptionally creative and it turns out as you'll find out that that pattern
which is called a Pareto distribution where most people stack up at zero and a
few people are way out on the creative end characterizes all sorts of
distributions like the distribution of money for example which is why 1% of the
people have the overwhelming majority of the money it's a different 1% across
time it like it churns and you're much more likely to be in the 1% if you're
older logically enough because one of the things you do as you age is you
trade youth for money if you're fortunate I don't think the trade is
really worth it but that's the best you've got so anyways those particular
traits you can think of those as ways that you simplify the world right
there's lots of different places that you can act in the world and there's
lots of different ways you can look at it and survive that's why you can be a
plumber and a lawyer and an engineer and those all work right even though they're
very different modes of being and you can have different personalities and
survive as long as you're capable of finding the place where your particular
filters and behavioral proclivities match the demand of the environment and
a huge part I would say of successful adaptation is precisely that now there
are other elements of personality too one of the things that I've been struck
by and this is actually one of the criticisms I have of the psycho analysts
and the clinicians in general even though I have great admiration for them
and would say that what they have to say is very much worth listening to is that
it's not obvious that your personality is inside you you know what you think
you know a human being is a strange multi-level thing and you might ask
yourself well for example know is your mother more a part of you
than your arm or maybe even more precisely is your child more a part of
you than your arm it's certainly people will do drastically self-sacrificing
things to maintain the lives of their children and so you're you're a person
and you're made out of all sub sort of subcomponents of a person none
of which you could see when you look at a person all the complicated machinery
inside you that makes you who you are and then outside of that of course
you're nested in all sorts of complex systems so you're part of a family and
and you're part of a community and that's part of a province and that's
part of the state and that's part of an international consortium of states and
that's part of an ecosystem and how you make a distinction between you and the
systems that you're embedded in is also of extraordinary difficulty and when it
and one of the things that you have to do as a clinical psychologist for
example if you're trying to diagnose someone with depression you think you
think well this person's dreadfully unhappy well you can think about that as
a problem with their psychological adjustment you know the way that they're
looking at the world but if you look at the epidemiological literature for
example one of the things that you find is that very many people have a first
depressive episode after something genuinely terrible has happened to them
right they've lost someone or they've become injured or or they've become
unemployed because unemployment is a terrible shock to people and it's not
precisely self-evident that you can consider someone who's unhappy and
desperate because they no longer have a job depressed they're certainly sad and
they're not doing very well but the fact that they no longer have an income is
actually something with dramatic practical consequences and treating that
as if it's a mental disorder seems to be counterproductive it's also the case for
example that if you're if someone comes into you to talk to you and they're very
upset and they may manifest the signs of say an anxiety disorder or again
depression or other other clinical 
features for that matter you have to do
a careful analysis of their manner in which they're embedded in their family
because and this is something that we'll talk about quite thoroughly when we come
to discussing Freud is that well you know it's not like everybody's families
are necessarily particularly happy places to be
you know I mean human beings are very dependent we have a very long period of
dependency partly because we're so cortically hyperdeveloped it takes a
very long time to program us into something that's vaguely capable of
maneuvering on its own and that produces of course the very tight familial bonds
that we all that we all desperately require because who wants to be alone in
the world but it also it also exposes us to the probability of becoming entangled
into even multi-generational family pathology and it isn't obvious always
uncertainty hasn't been to me when I've seen my clients that the fundamental
problem with the client is the client sometimes the fundamental problem is is
the family and and perhaps that person has been identified as the problem
person it's rather convenient for everyone who's involved to make that
presupposition it's also the case that this is the Freudian idea fundamentally
this is the Oedipal idea that it's very easy for people to become over dependent
on their parents and and for the parents to facilitate that and 
about this as experience out in the world or experience in the unconscious
mind there are dirty little secrets let's say and skeletons and dreadful old
fears and remnants of abuse and memories of pathological behavior and failures of
courage that you leave you undeveloped perhaps out of avoidance and that the
psychoanalytic process is precisely the careful encounter with those forgotten
and and repressed elements of the self in the hope that a clear encounter will
redeem them unites them with the remainder of your personality and make
yours make you stronger in consequence and I would say that that's just a
variant of the manner in which human beings learn and we'll talk about this
more in relationship to Piaget because you always learn when you're wrong which
is very annoying now what do you learn when you're correct you you're walking
in the world you're operating in the world you have a sense of what you want
to have happen you're always looking at the world through this sense of what you
want to have happen you're acting so that what you want to have happen will
happen and when it happens well then you're happy because well first of all
you get what you want and that's good maybe depending on what you want but
it's also good because if you get what you want when you act then it turns out
that your model of how to act is valid right the outcome that you get what you
want indicates no error on the part of your
model but it's very frequently the case that when you act to get what you want
you don't get what you want and then that's unpleasant because you don't get
what you want but it's even more unpleasant because it brings with it the
hint of a suggestion that the manner in which you're construing the world is
incorrect at some indeterminate level so for example if you tell a party tell a
joke at a party you presume that people will attend and then when they hear the
joke they will laugh and then if you tell the joke and it goes flat or even
worse disgusts and offends people then you're going to be taken aback and
that's partly because you didn't get what you want and that's not so good but
it's but it's more because there's something wrong with the way you
conceptualized the situation and then you're faced with a problem and the
problem is the emergence of a domain of the unknown it's like well what kind of
mistake did you make maybe you're not as funny as you think
you are not that could be a big problem maybe you're not around people that who
are the way you think they are maybe they don't like you as much as you
thought they liked you I mean the 
should try to understand what the person says because it's another tool for you
to use and 
can tell it's that imagine imagine that
there are two kinds of things that you need to know and I believe this to be
the case I believe that you need to know what the world is made of and I suppose
that's the proper domain of science but then you need to know how to act and
that's a whole different thing and you need to know how to act that's the thing
you need to know most of anything anything because of course you're a
living creature and action in relationship to desired goals is is
everything to you and you can think about that from a Darwinian perspective
you have to act at least so that you can survive at least so that you can find a
partner that's that's life and so part of the question is well how does the
world look if you think about it as a place to act and the answer isn't a
place of value free objects that's not what the world looks like and you can't
act in a world of value free objects because there's no way of choosing
between them if everything has zero value why would you choose one thing
over another you live in a world where things present themselves to you as of
different value and that's partly a consequence of your temperament although
it's a consequence of other things and so what I'm going to try to do is to
provide you with schema that describes the world of
morality roughly speaking which is how to act and tell you a little bit about
what I think the languages which I think was derived from Darwinian processes and
I believe that it's within that structure that the clinical theories
logically nest and so that'll give you a way of linking one theory to another
from a conceptual perspective without having to rely so much on sheer
memorization then we'll talk about heroic and shamanic initiation and the
reason we're going to do that is because well people people used shamanic
initiation for tens of thousands of years all over the world and they have a
particular kind of structure the paper by merchant Le ADA which is linked on
the site is a very interesting one and details out some of these processes
there have been intelligent commentators like Andre Ellenberger Burge a who wrote
the discovery of the unconscious which i think is an outstanding book who late
the processes that the psychoanalyst psychoanalysts uncovered in the late
part of the 19th century an early part of the 20th century back to these more
primordial rituals of personality transformation and so we're going to
situate ourselves in some sense in deep history talking first about the
underlying mythological landscape then talking about archaic modes of
personality conceptualization and transformation and then moving from
there into constructivism and and we're going to concentrate mostly on Jean
Piaget who is a developmental psychologist constructivists believed
that you make yourself out of the information that you gather in the world
so you're an exploring creature you explore specifically when the maps that
you're using in the world are no longer orienting yourself properly when they're
producing errors so you go out and gather information and assemble yourself
from the information that you discovered then the depth psychologists Jung and
Freud I think I'm going to with Jung I'm going to walk you through some films I'm
not going to use the film's per se I'm going to use Clips stills from the film
but in you know the film so in in
chronological order and I'm going to try to explain to you how you might use
Union presuppositions to understand what the films are about you know if you
think about a film say like The Lion King which is an extraordinarily popular
film it's a very strange phenomena that you go and watch it right I mean think
about it it's drawings of animated animals that
in some sense represent you they're very low resolution but you perceive them
immediately as living things and you attribute to the motivation and and and
motive power and understanding you do it automatically without even thinking
about it and there's a classic plot that lies underneath those stories and the
plots are very very very very old and that's why you can understand them and
the reason you can understand them is because life has a plot or maybe it has
a couple of plots a multitude of plots but life has a plot and if it didn't we
wouldn't be able to understand each other and so I'd like to illustrate that
for you by analysis of some of these films I think it's the best way to
understand someone as sophisticated as young who is very difficult to get a
handle on Freud I'm going to do the same thing all the way I'm going to show you
a film with Freud I'm going to show you a film called crumb which is a
documentary and it's about a very badly enmeshed family and the attempts of the
family members to I suppose escape that I'll talk to you about Freud I'll show
you the film that should give you a sense of Freudian psychopathology which
is a very difficult thing otherwise to understand then there's a midterm a
midterm is multiple-choice you'll do it in class you'll have lots of time to
finish it it'll cover the material that we took that we studied up to that point
then we're going to talk about Rogers Carl Rogers who was a humanist Rogers
has a body-centered philosophy I suppose and he's interested as well in optimal
personal development and the role that interpersonal communication plays in
that Rogers hypothesis fundamentally and it's a very interesting one is that
honest communication between two people can produce personnel
transformation and and you know you might think well you kind of know that
already because there's something very engaging about a deep honest
conversation where you're able to say things that you wouldn't normally say
where you're being listened to by someone who's actually listening to you
and you're listening to them and in the conversation you're moving both of you
further to a different point that's different than a conversation where
you're right and you're trying to convince me or I'm right and I'm trying
to convince you which I would say is the
