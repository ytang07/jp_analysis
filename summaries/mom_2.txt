OK, so the last time we were here we got maybe a third of the way through this story the story of Pinokio and the transformation of a marionette into something hypothetically real I'm gonna backtrack a few slides and it'll get us into it again so you remember that the blue fairy, so I would say that the benevolent element of mother nature in the schemata that we are going to use to investigate mythology was more or less allowed her entrance because Gepetto was a good guy and he wished for the right thing and so in some sense... here's a way of thinking about that... you know genetic / environmental studies on children's temperament have revealed something quite interesting which is that the shared environment that children have within a family so that would be what's the same about your environment and your brother's environment, the same doesn't have that much effect on your temperament or his temperament 'cause the presumption always was that within a family there is a shared environment, right? 
and the male dominance hierarchies in chimps seem to be the predominant ones, although the females also have a dominance hierarchy it's not quite so clear in bonobos, which seem to be more female-dominated but in any case, the primary chimp dominance structure is male and you could think, well it's like the caveman chimp who's biggest and toughest who necessarily rules, and who rules longest but that isn't what de Waal  found ; see, the problem with being... mean, lets say and not negotiating your social landscape, and not trading reciprocal favors is that no matter how powerful you are as an individual, two individuals three quarters your power could do you in and that happens with the chimps fairly regularly; if the guy on top is too tyrannical and doesn't make social connections, then weaker chimps, males, make good social connections and when he's not in such good shape, they take him down, and viciously too de Waal has documented some unbelievably horrendous acts of, let's call it, regicide among the chimpanzee troupes that he studied, mostly in the Arnhem zoo the big troupe there, that's been there a long time but he's very interested in prototypical morality, and here's some other examples of prototypical morality emerging among animals, there's many of them, but one is you know, if two wolves have a dominance dispute, again that would be more likely among the male wolves but it doesn't really matter, they basically display their size, and they growl ferociously and they puff up their hair so they look bigger, and you can see cats do that when they go into fight or flight not only do they puff up, including their tail, but they stand sideways and the reason they do that is because they look bigger right, 'cause they're trying to put up the most intimidating possible front so anyways, if two wolves are going at it, what they're really trying to do is to size each other up and they're trying to scare each other into backing off, fundamentally because, see, the worst-case scenario is like, you're wolf number one, and I'm wolf number two and we tear each other to shreds, but I win, but I'm so damaged after that wolf number three comes in and takes me out so, like, there's a big cost to be paid even for victory in a dominance dispute, if it degenerates into violence and animals, and human beings, but animals in particular, have evolved very, very specific mechanisms to escalate dominance disputes towards violence step by step so that they don't... so that the victor doesn't risk incapacitating himself by winning so what happens with the wolves is that, you know, they growl at each other and posture display, and maybe they even snap at each other but the probability that they're gonna get into a full-fledged fight is pretty low and what happens is, one of the wolves backs off,  and flips over and shows his neck and that basically means: "all right, tear it out," and the other wolf says: though of course he doesn't, "well, you're kind of an idiot, and you're not that strong, but we might need you to take down a moose in the future and, you know, despite your patheticness, I won't  tear out your throat" and then they've established their dominance position, and then, from then on, at least for some substantial period of time the subordinate wolf gives way to the dominant wolf but at least the subordinate wolf is alive, and, you know, he might be dominant over other wolves and so, everyone in the whole hierarchy has sorted that out either through mock combat or through combat itself and, you know, the low-ranking members aren't in the best possible position, but at least they're not getting their heads torn off every second of their existence so there's even some utility in the stability of the dominance hierarchy for the low-ranking members 'cause at least they're not getting pounded, getting threatened, which is way better I mean it's not good, but it's way better than actual combat and then there's the example of rats, which I love, this is Jaak Panksepp's work and he wrote a book called affective neuroscience, which I highly, highly recommend I have a list of readings, recommended readings on my website it's a brilliant book, and he's a brilliant psychologist, really, one of the top psychologists as far as I'm concerned both theoretically and experimentally, a real genius, he's the guy who discovered that rats laugh when you tickle them they laugh ultrasonically, so you can't actually hear them, but if you record it and slow it down then you can hear them giggling away when you tickle them with an erase, which  is sort of like their mother's tongue it's often what lab people use as a substitute for the licking of the little rat by the mother so, and he discovered the paly circuit in mammals, which is like a major deal, right he should get a Nobel prize for that, that's a big deal to discover an entire motivational circuit whose existence no one had really predicted, you know, apart from the fact that obviously mammals play and even lizards maybe, some of them are social lizards, seem to play so, anyhow, what Panksepp observed, and I think this is a brilliant piece of science is that, first of all, juvenile male rats in particular like to rough and tubmle play like to wrestle, and they actually pin each other like little kids do, or like adult wrestlers do they pin their shoulders down, and that basically means you win, and so, OK, so that's pretty cool but what's even cooler, I think, well there's three things, one is: the rats will work for an opportunity to get into an arena where they know that play might occur and so that's one of the scientific ways of testing an animal's motivation, right so imagine you have a starving rat and it knows that it's got food down in the end of a corridoor you can put a little spring on its tail and measure how hard it pulls, and that gives you and idication of its motivational force now, imagine the starving rat that's trying to get to some food, and you have a little spring on its tail, and you waft in some cat odor 
that was all to telly you that... oh yes, back to the rats so okay, the rats are pulling on... 
in order to go and do that, you'll object even if you don't really object it's like... , if you repeatedly pair these rats, unless the big rat lets the little rat win at least 30% of the time 
the little rat will not ask the big rat to play and that is... [?] here's the best strategy: I trust you, you trust me, we start interacting you screw up, I whack you, and then I forgive you, and we start again that's modified tit for tat, and so... 
; so someone had to paint thirty pictures to get a second of this you're not doing that accidentally, it's really expensive, and everyone has to agree on exactly what's going to happen and you might say: well, do the people who are doing this consciously know what they're doing? and the answer to that is: well, sort of, just like you do, it's yes, they know, and no, they don't and they know because they're really smart and gifted, and all that, but they don't know, because it's not all articulated plus they're working in a group, so they know and don't know, just like you do when you're watching it and so... and when you do anything else... now, they're also guided by what you might call... 
maybe you don't want to know that that's what you want, but the fantasy will tell you and it's partly... and he wasn't... 
but that's not Pinokio, he's like, spinning out, ready to go and so... good, good, he's got... I mean, I'm having a discussion with you, I'm trying to help you solve some crimes, which, by the way, I committed, but we won't bring that up you know, and you're accusing me of being a liar, you're not playing fair, what's up with you? 
or are you just afraid? what do you want? 
and what does the puppet know? 
some of you've been in my personality class and watched "Crumb", the documentary "Crumb" and that's another staggering exposition of exactly that kind of pathology anyways, one of the things Jung pointed out... it's all this idea of wealth and public exposure and zero attention whatsoever to anything regarding responsibility or discipline or learning and so it's a dual attraction, right, you get everything you want, and you don't have to do anything geez, what a deal; and so that's what the actor represents, it's a liar, fundamentally it's someone who's acting out a deception, they're a persona in the Jungian sense so the persona is the mask you wear in public that you might even think you are. 
that took me a long time to puzzle out with regards to interpreting this movie I could not figure out, I told you this, if the bug is the person who opens the hero narrative and who can guide the transformations of time and who has the same initials as Jesus Chris and is knighted by nature herself,
why is he such an idiot? it also shows you just exactly how much of a clue he has he's gonna wallop the bug who's sitting on the fox's hat, which I think he actually does then the fox can't get out of his hat, and has to talk through his hat, which basically he's doing all the time anyways so, this I really like, you see on the left here that the cricket is speaking inside this flower and like I said, there's nothing accidental in these representations these are artists who were coming up with these compositions, and their fantasy has a structure so the cricket is speaking out of this flower that has, well, you could think about it as... it has a sexualized element so you could think about that as a phallic part, and that part of the feminine part of it, they are flowers, after all 
anyways, the cricket tires to make a case for why Pinokio shouldn't go off to be a celebrity but, you know, it's a hard case to make, because the fox is very manipulative, and Pinokio is naive and it sounds like a good offer, and also the fox is actually quite forceful, he basically takes him by the hand so the temptation is, and this is something else I like about the movie you can't just say: "well, the puppet gets what he deserves" 'cause he's little and naive, and what he's facing is really malevolent, truly malevolent and physically overpowering, and so the movie does a nice job of not minimizing the threat that's posed by this particular temptation and that's part of what makes it art so we'll stop there, we'll have a break for 15 minutes, and then we'll start with the stage alright, so here we are, at the big event, and Pinokio is off to be a celebrity and the cricket is watching, and people are gonna notice that his peers are gonna notice that, the teachers are gonna notice that maybe it's too much independence even, but it's still a... 
I spent a lot of time thinking about Hitler, and I was thinking: how do you get into a state like that? and you think: he's a dictator, and he led his people down a bad path that's not right, that is not what happened; they had a conspiracy together, and went down a bad path think about it this way: if one person thinks something about you, it's like whatever, right? 
I would say, with a typical person, a hundred would do it that'll get you going, man, if a hundred people tell you specifically why you're special, you're gonna be thinkin'... ; so when I wrote the book on which this course is based I was thinking: "how am I gonna judge success?" and I thought: "well, there's sort of four... 
why don't they just throw your sorry ass into the camp? which is essentially what's gonna happen anyway; why do they need your collaboration? 
but it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter because he ends up in jail and he can't get out, and the fact that in some ways it wasn't his fault doesn't change the fact that he's in jail, and he can't get out and then his... I think it was Mark Twain, Samuel Clemens, who said: "one of the advantages to telling the truth is that you don't have to remember what you said" and that, God, that's worth listening to, because... there's a bunch of things that I learned as a clinician 
you see this with politicians, like that guy who was sexting Anthony Weiner, and perfect name for him, man, it's so funny I shouldn't make that comment 'cause it's so obvious, but it's still funny but that's exactly what happened to him, it wasn't even so much the event because people are stupid, they make mistakes, and actually the public is somewhat forgiving if you say: "yeah, geez, I'm a real moron, like really, seriously, how could I do that? but I did I'll try not to do it again"; but what happens with politicians is... and I'm not speaking specifically of politicians they'll make an error and it gets exposed, and then they'll make three others, trying to cover it up it happened with Nixon, for example, and then the whole thing turns into a complete scandal and maybe they could've got out of it at the beginning by just telling the truth "yes, I'm an idiot, I'll try not to do it again" that isn't what happens in this case, and Pinokio grows this elaborate series of lies and the fairy is willing to be a little generous to him, because he's little and cute, and he's still a puppet and she tells him not to do that and that she's gonna give him a pass this time, but that she isn't gonna be able to intervene on his behalf again and that's partly... one of the things that's quite interesting about people who have Rousseauian ideas about children so: children are all good, and they get corrupted by society, which is half true because they're also not good, and they get shaped and disciplined by society but the Rousseauian types often are very interesting when their kids hit teenage years or when they're judging, say, criminal teenagers it's like the child is perfect until they hit like 11, then they turn into a teenager, and the they're like thugs so they go from good to thug in one move; and you often see that in families, too that have treated especially their daughters like a princess, and then they hit puberty and the parents who have princessed them to death have no idea what to do with them so then they become demonized, so the overly good child turn into the overly wicket teenager and sometimes they'll act that out, too, one of the things I've seen with girls who are held in princess esteem when they're little 
and their parents have to tight [sic] a grip on them, and too much of a demand for good behavior is they'll find some nasty character associate with, who will tear them out of the family, bikers are really good for that sort of thing and especially if you have some vengeful thoughts towards your parents, a nice biker is your perfect solution to that problem okay, we'll go through this scene, and then I think we'll call it a day so now Pinokio's gone free, he's been reunited with his conscience, he's learned a couple of lessons 1. don't be an actor, 2. and don't lie, and those things are quite similar and especially once you're caught in your actor trap, don't lie to get out, 'cause that will just make it worse so that's the first of his trials, his moral trials on the road to becoming real now here we're at a different place, we're at this... partly, you watch people, because you know what they're like, because you know what you're like but you also know what you could do, and would do if you were pushed you don't have to show much of that when you're negotiating with someone for them to take you really seriously it's a strange thing; but one of the things Jung pointed out, too, was that what you most need to know will be found where you least want to look 
but how does morality go from [student] who's stronger and who's weaker to what's good and what isn't? we'll, I think it depends to some degree on what you mean by stronger so physical strength is one element, if you look at mythological heroes... 
what do the call it? WWF? 
it's not in the word, it's not in the phrase, it's not in the sentence, it's not in the paragraph, where do you localize the meaning? it's too complex to work out, so women in their genius don't 
or should we maybe call it a day? you mentioned the process where people do the thing that's less hard but still hard?
